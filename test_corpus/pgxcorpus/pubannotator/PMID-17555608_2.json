  "text": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The objectives of this study were , firstly , to characterize the inter-patient variability in the dose of propofol required to achieve a bispectral index < 70 and ' time to eye opening ' following propofol infusion and , secondly , to determine if the pharmacodynamic parameter ' time to achieve bispectral index < 70 ' was influenced by genotype of the sex-linked drug receptor gene GABRE or if pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and ' time to eye opening ' were influenced by the genotype of the metabolizing enzyme CYP2B6 ."

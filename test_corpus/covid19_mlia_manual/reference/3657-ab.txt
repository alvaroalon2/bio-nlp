Petition for alien relative
Refugees with Permanent Resident Alien status or who have been in the US more than five years can apply on behalf of spouses, children, parents, and siblings using Form I-130.
There are several different ways you can apply to have your family members come to the United States to join you after you have been resettled.
This means that they can become a refugee in the USA because they are a part of your family.
If you do not qualify for either of those programs and are now a US citizen, you can also complete a regular application to have your family immigrate to the USA.
This is called family reunification.
However, you may still be able to help family immigrate to the United States.
Affadavit of Relationship Program
This means that you were the person that received official refugee status and came to the USA through the US Office of Resettlement.
Only certain family members can become "derivative" refugees: your spouse (husband or wife) or your children (unmarried and under 21 when you first applied for asylum or refugee status).

Your child had to be conceived (this means the mother was already pregnant) or born before you entered as a refugee or were granted asylum.

You remain in refugee or asylee status or have become a permanent resident (received a green card).
In order to request to have your spouse or children join you in the USA under the Family Reunification Program, you must be what is called a "principal" refugee or asylee.
If you have already become a U.S. citizen through naturalization, you cannot petition to obtain derivative refugee or asylee status for a relative.
The Affidavit must be completed in order to begin the application process for relatives who may be eligible to enter the United States as refugees through the US Refugee Admissions Program.
Who is eligible to apply for family reunification?
If you want to complete papers to have your spouse come to the US, you had to be married before you came to the US as a refugee or were granted asylum in the US.
You must remain in refugee or asylee status or have become a lawful permanent resident (received a green card).

Both your doctor and pharmacist should confirm that you understand how to take your medication.

When you first arrive in the United States, you may not know what to do with your money or who to trust.
Banks and credit unions in the United States are safe and secure, and millions of Americans use banks.
Local shops may also accept your checks if they know you.
This page has bank information to help you understand the US system.
Keeping large amounts of money in your home or apartment or with you is not a good idea because it can get stolen or lost.
If you lose the card or it gets stolen, nobody can use it unless they know the PIN.
Be careful using your debit card online.
learn how to be safe shopping online .
It makes it easier to receive money from your employer.
To open a bank account, you will need at least a small amount of money.
You may have never used a bank before and wonder about how to open a bank account.
However, most savings accounts only allow you to take money out of the account a few times per month.
The amount you have is called your "bank balance."
Why you need a bank account
Checks and debit cards
If you write a check but do not have enough money for the check, you will be charged an overdraft fee of $50 or more.
You can earn interest by putting money in a savings account.
Savings accounts help you save money for the future.
It is better to be able to deposit money (put money in the bank) and withdraw money (take money out of the bank) without being charged a fee.
If you make a mistake, you can explain to the the bank it was a genuine misunderstanding and politely ask the bank to refund the fee, and they may or may not refund it.
Once you have a bank account, you need to be careful to spend only as much money as you have in your bank.
Bank employees should answer your questions and help you understand how banks and fees work.
To avoid mistakes, you can check how much money you have in savings or checking account at the bank, online, or at an ATM.
It is better to store most of your money in a bank or credit union.
It also makes it possible to pay for things through the mail or online.
You may feel nervous about giving your money to a stranger at a bank.
Opening a bank account
You can also use your debit card to pay for things in stores, online, and over the phone.
A debit card is a plastic card you use to get cash out of an ATM (automated teller machine), which is a machine that holds money.
Overdraft fees cost a lot of money, so it is wise to keep a very careful watch on your bank balance!
Once you are working, you can receive your paycheck as a direct deposit - this means it will go directly to your checking account from the employer.
When you use your debit card or checks, the money comes out of your bank account.
If you have some savings, or want to start saving, you can open a separate bank account.
Checks are forms you fill in and sign to pay for things.
Once you start making money you should open a bank account.
The person receiving your check deposits it in their bank, and your bank pays them out of your account.
Checking accounts allow you to deposit money and pay your bills.
You must also show two forms of identification (ID) to prove who you are.
You can open a savings account or a checking account.
You can use checks to pay bills, such as your rent and utilities.
You may get better rates at a credit union, which is a type of bank owned by its members.
In order to protect your identity, you have to have a PIN (personal identification number) to use your card. You enter your PIN every time you take money out of the ATM or buy something.
After you open your savings or checking account, you may receive a debit card and checks.

Bring your insurance card with you to every medical appointment or visit to the pharmacy.
If you still have questions, you can call the nurse at the doctor's office after your appointment.
If you or a family member is having difficulty at the doctor's office due to language, you can always ask for an interpreter.
Bring your insurance card and any other source of payment that you need

You can then ask a friend to translate the information to make sure you understand.
They will offer you an appointment time.
The doctor's office will ask for information about you.

To make a diagnosis, your provider will ask you questions about your current and past health history.
The person at the doctor's office will ask questions about you and your health insurance.
Ask them to look up translated information about the diagnosis.
Make sure you understand why they've made the diagnosis and ask them to recommend resources to help you learn more about the illness.
Write down the time, date, and address of the appointment.

For any other healthcare problems, common illnesses, or to get a check-up or vaccinations, you should make an appointment with a primary care doctor.
If you have see a new doctor, make sure they are in your insurance network so that your insurance will pay for the visit.
Before calling, find your health insurance card
Your provider may say you don't need to return until your next regularly scheduled appointment or they may want to see you sooner or have you referred to a specialist for treatment.
The information you provide will help direct the care you receive.
Hospitals have a large staff with many people serving in different roles, but there will be a doctor or other provider assigned to you.
Most doctor's offices and hospitals will be able to get an interpreter in person or on the phone who can assist you.
You can also ask the doctor to write a summary of your appointment and any information about prescriptions you need to take.

But if you are an asylee or refugee and return to the place you claimed protection from, you may lose your asylum status.
Although USCIS recommends that you file Form I-131 while you are in the United States, you are not required to be present in the United States for an approval and an issue of a Refugee Travel Document if you have submitted your biometrics (photograph, fingerprints).

Unfortunately there is usually a long wait for affordable housing.
Some listings pages will notify you when new advertisements are posted.
When you find a place to live, you will need to pay your bills on time.
However, you would still normally have to tell the landlord a month in advance that you will move and you must pay rent through the end of your agreement.
Some leases require you to clean your carpet in order to get your deposit back.
How to find a place to live
It is always important to have a good relationship with your neighbors, wherever you live.
If you are going to move out of your rental, be sure to check your lease to see how many days ahead of time you need to tell your landlord you will be moving.
You never need to pay rent until you have an agreement.
When new neighbors move in, you can introduce yourself and bring them a meal or plate of treats.
If you are prepared to share, you may actually end up in a nicer place, with more space or with a yard, because with roommates you can afford something bigger.
This money is kept by the landlord until you move out in case you do not pay your rent or if you make the rental unit very dirty and they have to pay to have it cleaned.
Signing a lease
If you do have to clean the carpet, you can rent a machine for a low price instead of having to pay a company a lot of money to clean the carpet.
If you need more help you can tell your landlord about the problem and ask them to talk to your neighbor.
When you fill it out, your mail will be sent to you at your new address.
In the lease, you agree to pay your rent and bills on time each month and the landlord agrees to provide a safe and sanitary (clean with no bugs) rental unit.
If it was not cleaned, ask for the landlord to put in writing that you do not have to clean the carpet.
Your home is an important place.
You will sign a lease, which is an agreement that says you will pay your rent and other bills each month.
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has good information about buying your first home and programs for first-time and low-income home buyers.
When you buy a home, you normally need to have saved money to pay for a down payment (a percentage of the total cost of the house), and then you often borrow money to pay for the rest of the house.
If there are things broken, or if the place is dirty, ask the landlord to write that down on the lease.
You have the right to live in a place that is clean, has no bugs, and has heat and water.
You can find local public housing agencies and counseling agencies in your area.
Length of lease
Be sure to check if the carpet in your apartment was cleaned when you moved in.

Each month you pay your mortgage payment to the bank for the money you borrowed.
Most leases will require you to give a certain number of days' notice before you move out.
You can look to find homebuying programs to help you buy a home in your city or state.

First, it offers employment services.
Legal information can be hard to understand, even in your first language.
In the USA, you can only receive public benefits for a certain amount of time.
You will need to use the money to pay your basic expenses like rent for your house/apartment and electricity bills.
You may need to get immunizations against certain diseases.
The goal of public benefits is to provide for your basic needs until you are able to become independent.
Here you will find information about the benefits you may receive when you arrive in the USA.
In legal settings, you have a right to have an interpreter and a translator.
You will have to follow the requirements of the RCA contracts and then receive monthly RCA checks.
Budgeting for your expenses in the USA can be very hard because you have to pay for things you may not realize.
Once you start working and earning an income for your family, you will stop getting public benefits.
The information on this page comes from the Office of Refugee Resettlement and other trusted sources.
All refugees receive medical care when they first arrive in the USA.
Unless you are a fluent English speaker, it is a good idea to use an interpreter.
Many refugees qualify for RCA but if you have a family with children or if you are elderly refugee, you may qualify for a different program.
The program may include scheduling your medical appointments, teaching you how to use public transportation and helping you find other resources and programs in your community.
The Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) Program provides a small amount of money during the first 8 months you are in the USA.
As a refugee, you are required to complete a medical screening with a doctor.
If you are a refugee or asylee who has been in the USA for less than 8 months, you will get some type of help from the government.
You may need to learn how to use debit cards and US banks .
Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) is a program that provides healthcare for asylees and refugees.
There are two main parts in Refugee Social Services.
The ORR Repatriation Program provides help to US citizens and their immediate family members who have returned to the USA after problems overseas, or who are escaping from civil unrest or natural disasters abroad.
The ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children Program provides temporary custody and care to unaccompanied alien children who do not have an immigration status.
Depending on your age, your family size, and what state you live in, you will qualify for a different medical program from the government.
The first eight months of being in the USA can be very difficult and your case manager can help you.
Refugee Social Services (RSS)
Employment specialists will maintain contact with you on your employment case on at least a once-monthly basis.
But most refugees and asylees say they feel very proud once they have a good job and can take care of themselves and their families.
If you are receiving federal cash assistance such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), you are not qualified for Refugee Cash Assistance.
The ORR Anti-Trafficking in Persons Program (ATIP) identifies and serves victims of human trafficking, assisting foreign trafficking victims in the United States to become eligible for public benefits and services to the same extent as refugees.
The Refugee Social Services program helps refugees and asylees for 5 years after the arrival in the United States.
You will learn about support from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and other services.
Am I eligible for public benefits for refugees and asylees?
We recommend you attend as many meetings and programs as possible with your caseworker.
The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) helps refugees and asylees restart their lives in the United States with cash, medical assistance, and other services.
This means you can only receive either Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) or federal cash assistance such as TANF or SSI, not both.
Sometimes, when you are learning a new language and adjusting to life in the USA, you may misunderstand what is happening or why you must do certain things.
The RCA program may also include other things to help you adjust to life in the USA.
Your resettlement agency will help you apply for the correct public assistance program.
Employment specialists in the RSS can help you finding appropriate employment.
The RCA also helps you to be connected with Refugee Social Service (RSS) program for employment assistance and for long-term casework to meet individual needs.

They will discuss job opportunities, apply and interview for jobs, practice for upcoming interviews, and more.
Refugee Social Services includes employment services, job training, educational services, including English as a Second Language instruction and immigration assistance, case management services, and other support services.
You can get other help such as job training, English lessons, and other services to help you become independent in the USA.
Your resettlement agency will help you apply for medical assistance.
Public benefits for refugees and asylees
You must complete a lot of paperwork to get public benefits.
The RSS program also helps with case management for you to be able to take care of your family.
Public benefits for refugees and asylees can be confusing.
Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA)
This can be hard for parents.
You can also search for a local organization in FindHello .
Then select "Children &amp; Teens."
This means they check if the daycare is safe or not.
There might even be specific programs just for refugee youth.
Most babysitters will come to your house.
Some are for studying - for example for learning computer skills.
In the USA, camps do not actually mean camping.
Here is some information to help you understand the different types of childcare in the USA.
Only use babysitters you know and trust or who have been recommended by people you know and trust.
Children go for the day and usually focus on a particular activity.
Most states also have programs to help you find a daycare in your area.
This can save you money but it also means you might not see each other very much.
There are different types of daycares.
A babysitter is an individual whom you pay to watch your children.
Sending your children to daycare can be sad or confusing.
Instead, their primary responsibility has been to take care of their children and their home.
This is a good idea if you have family, neighbors, or friends who have children close in age to your children.
You can send your children to preschool when they are about two years old.
But in the USA, you may have to use childcare while you work.
If you need childcare before and after school, you should look into after-school programs.
The Boys and Girls Club has clubs all over the USA.
These programs will help your children adjust to their new schools, make friends, and get help with homework.
Most daycares require you to register and to pay monthly.
Free and low-cost professional childcare
You should ask your babysitter to take a CPR and First Aid class.
The US has a national program, called HeadStart, which offers free preschool for low-income families.
Some refugee and immigrant parents have never had someone else take care of their children.
We recommend you choose a daycare that is licensed.
Sharing care with other families
Some cities have drop-in day cares where you can bring your children for just a few hours.
If you are married, you and your spouse may be able to work different hours so that you do not have to send your children to daycare.
Many refugee and immigrant mothers have never worked outside of the home or used childcare.
The YWCA has after-school programs and also offers childcare and Headstart programs.
Many summer residential camps also offer reduced fees for low-income families.
You can find a HeadStart program near you by searching the HeadStart locator .
You may be able to find another parent who will "swap" childcare with you.
They are not in a private home, and they have more children at them.
Preschools help prepare kids for school.
Ask at the school or community center about summer camps.
"Daycare" means the daily care of your children by someone other than you, typically outside of your own home.
Many schools will offer low-cost or free after-school programs for kids.
Sometimes teenagers will babysit.
Type in the words "after school clubs in [name of your city]."
Sharing care with your spouse
Can I manage without childcare?
The state also makes rules for daycares to follow.
You may find it possible to manage without professional paid childcare.
This means you send your child to somebody else's home who watches the kids.
Type in the words "licensed daycare in [name of your city]"
Ask at your child's school to see if they know of any after-school programs that would be good for your child.
As well as day camps, there are residential camps, where children go and stay for a week.
In the USA, women and men both work outside of the home. To have enough money, you will probably have to work outside of your home, especially if you are a single parent household.
By learning about different types of childcare and how to find good childcare, you may feel happier about sending your children to daycare.
Learn about childcare choices and how to find the best childcare for you and your child.
One option is an in-home daycare.
During the summer, you may be able to find day camps to send your child to.
These are likely to be for sports for other outside experiences.
You can find YWCAs and Boys and Girls Clubs near you.
To find licensed daycare in your community, search on the internet.
To find after-school programs in your community, search on the internet.
This means you will watch their children one day and they will watch your children one day.
This can also be hard for men from some cultural backgrounds, if they are not used to caring for their children at home.
For example, you can find sports camps, art camps, drama camps, church camps, etc.
State governments license in-home daycares and daycare centers.

Negotiations are discussions that lead to an agreement.
It is important to practice and know the right time to ask.
It is best to ask for 5% to 10% more than the employer offered you.
Sometimes, you will not get any increase.
Usually, they will increase their offer to a figure somewhere between the first amount and the one you asked for.
Focus on the job, not on your personal needs
Some jobs offer bonuses at the end of the year.
It is difficult to ask for more money at your job.
When the employer sends you an offer letter, thank them for the offer and say you would like to think about it.
It also shows the employer you are confident about your skills.
A job that pays $25,000 a year but gives you $10,000 more in benefits is better than a job that pays $30,00 a year with no benefits.
Before the deadline, call or email the employer.

Some places are much more expensive to live than others.
Employers will pay more for good skills and experience.
When you are negotiating a salary, you should think about more than just money.
Watch a video with more tips about how to negotiate your salary

If health benefits, bonuses, or vacation time are more important to you, negotiate for those instead.
If you decide to ask through email, you can use this salary negotiation email template.
In those places, employers have to offer more money for the same job.
If you meet all of the requirements and have prior job experience, consider if you should ask for a higher salary.
Do some research and find out if the salary offered fits with the average salary for the job and location.
Talk about your skills and experience.
Are you applying for a job that is hard to fill?
Negotiating a raise is like negotiating a starting salary.
Before you can start a new job, you and your employer will agree how much you will be paid and what benefits you will receive.
The employer may pay more if he is having a hard time finding qualified workers.
Do your research: what are other people are being paid at your level and for similar jobs?
Your experience, education, and qualifications all improve your skills.

Public transportation is an important part of life in the USA.
For example, you may ride bus number 52.
This means if the bus costs $1.50 you need to have one dollar and fifty cents.
How to use public transportation
There are online guides for Boston, Los Angeles, New York , San Francisco Bay Area , and Washington DC.
Buses usually have different hours on weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) and weekends (Saturday and Sunday).
Other forms of transportation
At first, it may be difficult to understand directions and you may get lost.
To do this, you can read the US driver's manual in many languages .

You can bring a piece of paper with you that says the name of the place you are going.
Having a car is very convenient.
Taxis are common in big cities like New York, and some business people take taxis every day.
Each big city has a different subway system.
If you are choosing where to live, try to find an apartment or house near public transportation, if possible.
If you are young and you see an elderly person on the bus, it is polite to give them your seat anyway.
Learn how to lock your bike .
You must give up these seats to seniors, disabled people, or pregnant women.
This bus will follow the same route every time and will stop at the same places.
You will need different types of transportation to get to work, school, and places to shop.
Subway lines are like train lines.
Most buses have a route name or number.
Most schools and workplaces have bicycle parking areas.
You will need information about driving in the USA .
For example, you might carpool to work if you live near someone who works at the same job as you.
However, taxis are very expensive, and they can get stuck in traffic, just like buses.
Many big cities have online guides with instructions on how to use the subway system.
This means a group of people ride together in one car to the same location.
Practice your bus ride before your first day of work or school.
Most of the trains travel underground in tunnels, but sometimes the trains go above the ground too.
Bicycles are easy to steal and are in great demand, so invest in a good lock and be sure to always secure the entire frame and wheels to a solid metal object.
They may have printed maps to give you, and most bus stations have maps on large information boards.
The bus may also have different hours or not run on holidays, such as Christmas.

There may be a ticket window with a person to help.
The bus driver will not give you change.
Some of the distances you need to go are too far to walk.
Most subway systems have more than one line.
You can find information for other subway systems by searching online.
If the bus is not crowded, it is nice to thank the bus driver when you get off.
In the USA, the law says you must have car insurance.
Biking is especially good if you live in a smaller town.

It is an online tool that will give you directions to where you are going via walking, public transportation, or driving.
Subways and metro systems are city railways that move large numbers of people from station to station.
Before you reach your stop, you sometimes need to ring a bell or buzzer, typically located on the wall or ceiling of the bus, to tell the bus driver to stop.
You may also be able to car-pool (get a ride with someone who has a car).
You should ride your bike going the same direction as car traffic, you should learn common hand signals to tell other drivers what you are doing, and you should wear a helmet.
You will also need to learn how the buses and subways work.
However, the metro system often costs more than riding the bus.
A taxi is a car you hire to take you from one place to another.
Seniors and students may even be able to ride the public transportation bus for free.
Pay the bus driver your fare, which is the price for your bus ride.
If you are going to carpool, you must make sure the driver of the car has a valid driver's license and up-to-date insurance.
Type the name of your city and then the words "subway system information."
It is often cheaper to buy a monthly bus pass if you will be riding the bus a lot.
One great way to get places is to carpool with someone else who has a car or to use a ride-share.
However, if you live in the suburbs or in a city without a good bus or metro system, you may want to get a car.
Many cities also have vans or cars especially for senior citizens and the disabled.
You will need to learn the driving regulations.
When you see the bus with your number coming, stand by the bus stop sign and wave your arm.
Carpooling and ride-shares
You may want to take an early bus to make sure you arrive to work on time.
If you are unsure where to get off the bus, tell the bus driver.

But they do allow you to build good credit.
If you do not pay back the credit card every month, you will pay interest.
So you pay back a lot more than you borrow.

Credit unions may give you a better choice for emergencies than a payday loan: a payday alternative loan (PAL).
People borrow money from a lender to pay back on the day they get paid.
And if you don't pay back on time, you will have to pay even more interest.
But credit card companies will not give you a credit card unless you already have good credit!
Credit and loans are both ways to borrow money.
Secured credit cards are not really credit because you have already given the money, or someone has promised to pay for you.
But your credit union may help you.
Banks and credit card companies have secured credit cards, too.
You may not want to use a credit card because of the risk of getting into debt.
Your credit history is a record of what you have borrowed and how well you paid it back.
So you need a credit card to build your credit history.
The longer you do not pay, the more interest you owe.
Credit unions help by lending money or giving credit cards to people with low incomes and people with no credit history.
Interest is the amount you pay on top of what you borrowed.
Getting a payday loan means you already have less money to get through until your next paycheck.
Mortgages are loans people get to buy a house.
You can find a credit union near you .
You have to be a member of the credit union for a month before you can take out a PAL.
Also, payday lenders charge a lot of interest.
Payday loans are for people who need cash quickly.
A PAL is a short-term loan so you don't have to get a payday loan.
Credit cards are easy and safe to use for shopping and paying bills.

A good rule followed by many pet owners is never to do anything to a companion animal that you would not do to a child.

The old shirt
We changed our name to make sure newcomers from all backgrounds feel welcome on our website and in our classroom.
The Refugee Center Online is now USAHello.
And it was her son's size.
There is nothing in the text about being strong or not strong.
But he didn't want to - the old shirt was red (his favorite color) and it had the name of his favorite team on the back.
Don't choose it yet.
Now watch this video to review the 5 steps with a different question
"Why not wear one of your other shirts?"
Elizabeth's son wore the same old shirt with holes every day.
Whenever you answer multiple choice questions, use the 5 steps!
The key words are text and mean.
Is this the best answer?
That word is identical.
Many questions on your GED® or other tests will be multiple choice questions.
The word favorite is in the text, but if you used favorite in the place of identical, the text would not make sense anymore.
The text will help you see what the word means.
Read all the answer choices one by one.
For each answer choice, ask yourself: "Is this the best answer?
One day, Elizabeth was in the secondhand store.

Don't choose your answer yet.
How to answer multiple choice questions

Learn how to choose the best answer to multiple choice questions
Directions: Read the passage of text.
Look at answer choice A: different
B is a good answer.
Step 2 - read the question
It had the same team name!
Except for having no holes, the shirt was identical to her son's.
So answer choice D is wrong.
Then choose the best answer to the question.
Nothing in the text would make sense if it meant different.
Step 3 - read the text
The question is asking you for the meaning of a word in the piece of text you were given.
Look at answer choice D: favorite
A familiar flash of red on the men's shirt rail caught her eye. She looked at the back of the shirt.
Read the text above while you keep the question in your mind: "In this text, what does the word identical mean?"
Step 1 - read the directions
Question: In this text, what does the word identical mean?
Is this what identical means?
The question is: "In this text, what does the word identical mean?"
Is this what identical means?"

Independence is sometimes referred to as individualism.
The idea of "losing face" is not the same in America.
Generalizations are not always true, but things that are often true.
In the United States, this is often not the case.
Many people who work very hard do not have very much money.
Instead, go to the front door and knock or ring the bell.
In general, it is good to remember that what may appear rude is not intended that way.
For example, when you first meet someone, one of the first questions they might ask you is "What do you do?"
There is a saying in America: time is money.
This means, for example, if your neighbor got a new car, you might want a new car also.
The translation for "losing face" would be "embarrassed," which is less serious.
You do not have to feel you must have lots of possessions to be respected.
Today more and more people realize the American Dream is not true.
In your country, you probably had strong traditions and culture that you valued.
Competition in business is due in large part to the capitalist economy.
This idea is a part of what is called the "American Dream."
Collective cultures tend to see accomplishments as a reflection of an entire family or community.
If a friend or neighbor asks you if you need anything, they truly want to help.
If she introduces herself as Dr. Wilson, that is what she prefers to be called.
If there is no answer leave a note on the door, asking permission to retrieve the toy between 8am and 8pm.

Bedrooms are usually considered private spaces.
Elders in particular typically need more peace and quiet and may not want to be disturbed.
Sometimes people who you might expect to treat you with respect may treat you as an equal.
In America, there is not a strongly embedded social hierarchy or caste system.
Men and women should be treated equally, and men are not viewed as better than women.
Most Americans love to help, and need very little encouragement to become good friends and neighbors.
This means they think Americans work too much.
For example, children may call an older adult by their first name.
If you open a gate you must close it.
You may still have to wait for the appointment.
The US Declaration of Independence declares, "All Men Are Created Equal."
Neighbors and friends are entertained in the kitchen, dining room or living room.
This is different than in many other cultures which are more collective.
Or, if you need winter clothes for example, and you're not sure where to buy them, it is OK to ask, "Do you have any suggestions for where I can buy inexpensive coats and boots for my children?"
Overall, the value placed on competition may cause you to feel some culture shock, especially if you came from a culture that is more collaborative than competitive.
Remember, neither way is better than the other way - just different.
Those are just some examples of privacy that may be different in your culture.
American children tend to leave the home earlier than in other cultures.
This means they often tell you what they think and they will be assertive about what they want.
Some people do not like talking about these subjects in public because they are worried it will cause people to argue.
However, if you come to an open gate, leave it open.
This may be because they want to be "on time" for their next appointment.
This is both respectful and safe, as some people have guard dogs or may be very protective of their privacy.
Many early immigrants moved to America to follow the American Dream.
For a large party with many people, you can be 30 to 40 minutes late.
Competition can be seen in school, in the workplace, and in sports.

Parents and children tend to have their own bedrooms, and often, American children each have their own bedrooms.
In conversation, if an American disagrees with your opinion, they might tell you.
For example, students may work hard to achieve the best grades.
In classes, Americans may challenge their teachers' ideas.

The goal of USAHello is to provide generalizations to help you better understand why an American may be acting in a way you do not understand.
These tend to be based more on individual success: for example, someone's job, wealth, or education.
In some cultures, it is impolite to disagree with your teacher.
Even young children participate in lots of activities outside of school, such as sports, music lessons, and volunteering.
You should feel comfortable living simply or any way you prefer, maybe saving more money for emergencies, education and retirement rather than spending on objects to impress others.
Americans may also "compete" with themselves.
In fact, if someone greets you informally and calls you by your first name, it probably means they think of you in a friendly way.
You use the same greeting no matter who you are talking to: your son or your son's teacher.
American society is often informal and relaxed.
In some situations, however, it is better to be more formal and to use last names until you are asked to use a first name - for example, in a business situation or at school.
While the informality of US culture may surprise you, it is not meant to be rude.
All of the above statements are generalizations of American values.
Sometimes competition involves groups, such as a soccer team or a school study group.
Americans may be embarrassed if they are criticized or make a mistake, for example.
If a teacher or a doctor introduces herself as "Lucy" or "Doctor Lucy", that is how you should address her.
Often people who come from privileged backgrounds have an easier time moving up in the world.
Most Americans will be happy to teach you about how Americans view the world.
In a classroom, all students should be treated equally by their teachers.
Sometimes, you may feel like someone is leaving very quickly or is in a hurry to leave.
When making a business deal, you may spend time getting to know the other person, maybe while drinking tea or coffee.
This does not mean they do not like you, just that they may have a different idea.
So even if they have a phone that works, they may want a new phone because it has new and exciting features.
If your children lose a ball or other toy over a neighbor's fence, it is generally a bad idea to jump over the fence and retrieve the toy.
Still, the idea of equality is an important part of US culture.
For example, after graduating high school, many children move out to go to college or start working.
If you can't call, you should tell the person you are sorry for being late when you arrive.
Understand American values and learn about what is important to Americans.
Americans call this "Keeping up with the Joneses."

Americans often give each other more space in public situations than people in other cultures.
In conversations, many Americans are private about certain things and do not want to talk about them, such as their age, how much money they make, or their political, sexual and religious views.
People also tend to identify strongly with their jobs.
You will see why Americans are direct and informal and why competition, work ethic, and buying things are all important in the USA.
Americans are very proud of being self-reliant, or being able to take care of themselves, and they tend to think others should be self-reliant as well.
When you first start a job, it is a good idea to dress more formally and then to choose your attire based on what the people around you are wearing.
When greeting someone, Americans tend to say, "Hi" or, "Hello."
Men or women who work at home taking care of the family often call themselves "home-makers" and deserve respect for this occupation as much as any other.
A good rule is that anytime you are going to be late, you should call and let the person you are meeting know you will be late.
So Americans may point out mistakes or criticize you, simply intending it as a correction or useful information.
Sometimes Americans will tell you how they prefer to be addressed when they introduce themselves.
However, it is important you are on time or you may have to reschedule the appointment.
However, Americans like to believe the idea that all people should have equal opportunities.
Many Americans view material items such as TVs or shoes as a way to show they are successful at work.
When filling out an application of any kind, it is OK to write "home-maker" as the occupation for someone who does not have a paying job outside the home.
Americans are not trying to be rude - they are just being direct.
Americans may dress casually, such as wearing jeans or shorts even at work, school, or church.
Part of the reason Americans are work-oriented is because being busy and active is often seen as a good thing.
In the United States, there are also important American values.
Many Americans view competition is a good thing.
What are American values?
Activities with friends: If you are invited to someone's house for dinner, try to be on time - you can be 5 or 10 minutes late, but if you are much later than that, you should probably call and let them know.
Americans place a lot of value on their time.
If you have a hard time adjusting to the American sense of time, you may want to get a watch or phone that has an alarm to remind you of the time, especially for getting to work.

What is important to Americans?
Americans can be very focused on their work.
Americans can be competitive and often work hard to achieve their goals.

But you cannot receive more than 12 months total benefits in a 36-month period.
The information on this page comes from USCIS and other trusted sources.
It is intended for guidance and is updated as often as possible.
Applicants filing for a change of status will be asked to make a declaration of self-sufficiency (Form I-944).
Officers will consider your health and age.
This information was prepared with thanks to Protecting Immigrant Families and CLINIC .
They also look at your education and income.
What does this mean for immigrants and visa applicants?
What are public benefits?
If you are looking for a free or low-cost lawyer or legal help, we can help you find free and low-cost legal services .
They may include long-term care, for example in a home for disabled or elderly people.
Are any benefits allowed before a person is considered a public charge?
Each benefit counts separately.
So if you receive rental assistance as well as food stamps in the same month, that counts as two months of benefits.
Healthcare programs used by children and pregnant women are not included.
Many benefits cannot be considered in the decision.
For example, you can show your assets, your skills, your good health, and your employment record.
The public charge rule does not apply to green card holders (unless they leave the USA for over 180 days and then try to come back into the country).
You have a right to show why you are unlikely to become a public charge.
The rule does not apply to US citizens or legal permanent residents (green card holders).
Who does the rule not apply to?
If you are unemployed, that will count against you.
If you have private health insurance, that will count in your favor.
How has this changed with the new rule?
Some amount of public benefits are allowed.
It does not apply to refugees, to asylees, and Afghanis and Iraqis with special immigrant visas.
Are you applying for a US visa, an extension to a visa, a green card, or change of status?
It will tell you how it may affect you.
If you are or if you become a legal permanent resident (green card holder), and then you use public benefits, it could make it harder to sponsor your other family members to come to the USA.
It may apply to you if you are listed on someone's else benefits, even you are not getting benefits directly yourself.
Who does the new rule apply to?
A public benefit can mean cash for low-income families.
What important facts I should know about the public charge rule?
This page will help you understand the public charge rule.
The public charge rule does not apply to refugees, asylees, or victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes.
What else affects the decision about whether someone is or will be a public charge?
Immigration officials must look at all your circumstances when they decide if you are likely to become a public charge in the future.
Now, inadmissibility will be based on non-cash public benefits, too, such as food stamps and other benefits listed above.
What does "Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds" mean?
The new rule applies to non-US citizens who are applying to come to the USA.
Public benefits are money and other help that is paid for using US taxes, or public money.
It also includes people already in the United States who apply to change their status or extend their stay.
What is public charge and how will it affect me?
This form says the applicant can support himself or herself without public benefits.
Inadmissibility means not allowed.
In the past, "public charge inadmissibility" was based on cash benefits.
Most people applying for a visa, change of status, or green card do not qualify for the public benefits listed in the rule anyway.
Health, housing, nutrition and other non-cash benefits provided by state and local governments are not included.
It also means people already in the USA may be denied a change of status, a green card, or an extension to their visa if they receive or have received public benefits or if officials think they will receive them in the future.
WIC, CHIP, school lunches, food banks, shelters, and child care assistance are not included.
DHS officers can look at other facts to decide (make a determination) about your case.
The public charge rule says that you may be denied a change of status, a green card, or an extension to your visa if you receive or have received public benefits or if officials think you will receive them in the future.
For people overseas, the rule means you may not be allowed to come to the USA if officials believe you will rely on public benefits.
So "Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds" means a person may not be allowed to come to the USA if there is reason to believe he or she will rely on public benefits.
Public benefits include SNAP (food stamps), housing vouchers or other housing assistance, and healthcare paid for by the government, such as Medicaid.
This is because your family members will need to pass the public charge test, and so the government will look at sponsors to see if they can support new family members.
Some public benefits will not be included in the new rule: for example, school lunches, children's health insurance, Head Start, emergency medical care and disaster relief will not be included.
These benefits can take many different forms.

They are seen as the start of the Gay Liberation Movement in the USA.
When people first became infected with HIV, scientists and doctors did not understand the disease.
They arrested people who were dressed in clothes of the opposite sex.
The community responded with protests and riots.
Those riots were not peaceful, but they inspired today's peaceful Pride parades.
Without treatment, it becomes AIDS.
There are parades, picnics, parties, workshops, concerts, and more.
It was a proud, historic day.
Because of them, more medical research has been done to find cures and treatments.
Many people died because there was no cure or treatment.
The Pride flag was designed in San Francisco in 1978 by artist Gilbert Baker.
The most famous of trans leaders were named Marsha P. Johnson and Silvia Rivera.
In 2015, the Supreme Court allowed people to get married in all 50 states.
The riots were led by transgender women and lasted three days.

Pride Month history
LGBTQ couples are not always allowed to do things that non-LGBTQ couples can do together.
There are Pride parades around the world.
Pride Month started after the 1969 Stonewall Riots in Manhattan, New York.
To celebrate Pride Month, communities organize pride parades and events across the USA.
It would not have happened if the LGBTQ community did not fight for their rights.
In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of LGBTQ people were affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
At nighttime gatherings, people hold candles and listen to speeches.
It is a rainbow flag that represents the diversity of genders and sexual orientations in the community.
In 1987, thousands of people created a quilt and displayed it in Washington, DC, to remember those who had died of AIDS.
Participants often wear colorful clothing, and some wave LGBTQ flags.
If you do not know the LGBTQ community or want to find friends in the LGBTQ community, Pride Month is a way to learn and celebrate.
The blue stripes represent the male gender and the pink represents the female gender.
LGBTQ people protested because the government was not doing research.
Pride Month is a time to celebrate but also to remember.
There are separate events and parades that focus on transgender people.
There are other flags for groups within the LGBTQ community.
In the USA, LGBTQ people do not have equal rights in all states.
Transgender people are often blocked from getting healthcare, applying for jobs, or even joining the military.
Police broke into the Stonewall Inn, a popular LGBTQ bar.
The LGBTQ community helped people learn about this disease.
There is a separate transgender flag to support transgender people, who face different struggles.
During Pride Month, many groups, organizations, and communities show support for the LGBTQ community by displaying the Pride flag.
They remember LGBTQ people who have died because of anti-LGBTQ violence or AIDS.
The white stripe in the middle is to symbolize people who are transitioning from one gender to another.
The Stonewall Riots were a response to police violence against LGBTQ people.
Around the world, the LGBTQ people are working to create community, fight for rights, and educate others.
June is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month in the USA.
The events vary, but all of them are meant to honor and support LGBTQ people .
The entire month is a time for LGBTQ people and others to celebrate, honor their history, and support their communities.
They may look different, but all Pride parades support the LGBTQ community by providing visibility.
A large group of activists, called ACT UP, organized public "die-ins." At these events, people would lie on the ground to show how the crisis was affecting people.
You should have at least two, but you do not need more than six. Three or four would be just right.

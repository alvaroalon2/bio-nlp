Opening of the 4 new Advanced care centres
COVID-19: hotline 8002 8080 now provides psychological support
Installation of a reception structure for patients next to the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL)
After the opening of the Advanced care centers (Centres de soins avancés - CSA), the daily balance sheet and forecasts will make it possible to best anticipate the day-to-day management of the influx of patients.
The project is one of the several initiatives put in place under the aegis of the task force to help contain the current pandemic.
In order to fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19), a patient reception structure next to the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg will be installed during the next few days, with the support of the NSPA (NATO Support and Procurement Agency) which has provided us with the equipment.
The hotline 8002 8080, set up in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, now offers multilingual psychological support, seven days a week, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.

The Research Luxembourg COVID-19 task force announces the launch of "CON-VINCE", a study that aims to evaluate the dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 disease within the Luxembourgish population.
Covid-19: Launch of the CON-VINCE Study
On 20 April 2020, the Prime Minister, Minister of State, Xavier Bettel and the Minister of Health, Paulette Lenert, had a first informal exchange with the Advisory Council to accompany the measures decided as part of the fight against COVID-19.
The person has been taken into charge according to the usual procedures.
Functioning:
Open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the first phase, including weekends.
The number of these consultation lines can be increased if necessary.
Medical and administrative staff:
Press release by the Ministry of Health
By way of illustration, the treatment capacity in Luxembourg City is 1,500 patients per day - 25 people are present there continuously.
If the test is positive, they are redirected according to their state of health.
However, emergencies must respect the usual channels in place in Luxembourg and not go through the CSAs.
If necessary, it is planned to extend the opening hours as needed.
Either they can go home for self-isolation or they are transferred to a hospital structure in a specially equipped ambulance if their state of health requires it.
A team is also involved in gathering administrative information and another team is in place to handle logistics.
Then a clinical examination is carried out by a physician.
The CSAs have been opened with variable consultation lines, according to the sanitary needs of each sector.
Finally, consultation in a CSA is free of charge: The patient will have to bring his social security card and an identity document.
A CSA, in its initial configuration, can allow up to eight doctors to be seen in parallel.
In order to limit waiting times as much as possible, each channel provides healthcare of several patients in parallel.
Their data are recorded by separate administrative departments and they are then attended by a nurse who takes their first anamnesis.
The CSAs are ambulant treatment centres that have the necessary medical equipment for initial care.
He is assisted in his care by nurses who take vital signs (measurements of basic body functions) and collect clinical information.
These new facilities are designed to operate through two strictly separate lines of consultation - the first is designed to accommodate patients with signs of COVID-19 infection, the second is designed to accommodate patients who come to the centre with no signs of COVID-19 infection.
However, if a patient's state of health deteriorates while under the care of the CSA, a medical evacuation is planned.
At the reception desk, they are thus directed either to the protected COVID-19 channel or to the general medicine channel and find themselves in separate waiting rooms.
In order to meet the essential criteria of avoiding contact between patients with symptoms of COVID-19 and other patients, these individuals are triaged as soon as they arrive at the Advanced care centre.
Patients who are suspected by the physician of having COVID-19 infection are tested on site.
A physician is responsible for the clinical examination of patients during the entire time the CSA is open.
It is essential to buy time, considering the scale of this epidemic', said the Minister of Health Paulette Lenert.
"The establishment of this separate flow is part of the Government's efforts to curb the spread of the virus.
Three on-call Medical centres are available in the country:
The 3 on-call Medical centres in the country will be open on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m..
From 18 March, general physicians' Medical centres receive patients with symptoms of a severe respiratory infection.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the Medical centres, please only visit the Medical Centre as directed by your treating physician.
The objective of this new mode of operation of the Medical centres is to offer people suffering from an acute respiratory infection a dedicated care circuit around three axes: reception and triage of patients - medical consultation - sampling.
The purpose of this channeling is to concentrate these patients outside of emergency departments and general practices, so as to contain the spread of the epidemic, and to provide on-site access to collection capacity for diagnosis of infections by staff with the required protections.
The Health Directorate will continue to inform the public on a regular basis.
Both have been taken into charge according to the usual procedures.
At present, the progression of the virus differs from that of neighbouring countries, because so far, all persons diagnosed in Luxembourg have been infected abroad.
The sixth person has been staying in the United States and the seventh has returned from a trip in Switzerland.
The Health Directorate informs that a sixth and a seventh case of COVID-19 has been diagnosed today.
The government would like to remind citizens that in case of symptoms of an infection (cough, fever or respiratory problems), they shouldn't go to the doctor nor the emergency room, but call 8002 8080 or, in case of an emergency, 112.
Also, people with those symptoms should refrain from visiting vulnerable people.
The public is invited to consult the FAQs available on the website www.gouvernement.lu/coronavirus for further information on the coronavirus and precautionary measures.
Specifically, these include:
At this stage, participation of volunteers from the general population is unfortunately not possible (yet).
About the statistically representative panel
Therefore, LIH will contact eligible candidates directly to participate in the study.
Therefore, at present, no comprehensive data on the epidemiology and dynamics of the disease exist.
We continue to put huge efforts to gather the best information in order to get ahead of the virus".
Conversely, symptomatic patients will be excluded from the study and undergo regular treatment instead.
The choice of participants in the panel needs to accurately reflect the actual composition of the Luxembourgish population in terms of age, gender and geography, in order to avoid biased and statistically inaccurate results.
Press release by Ministry of Health / Research Luxembourg and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research / National Research Fund
This will generate accurate data on the transmission of the disease, ultimately assisting policy-makers in taking evidence-based decisions over the course of the coming weeks.
The CON-VINCE study will be one of the key elements for an empirical basis in the handling of the current crisis"
Testing asymptomatic individuals to assess COVID-19 spread in Luxembourg
Asymptomatic individuals - often referred to as "silent carriers" - and mildly symptomatic carriers play a significant role in the spread of the virus.
The market research company TNS-ILRES, Ketterthill, Laboratoires Réunis and BioneXt Lab are associated partners in this study.
The analyses will initially be carried out on collected nasal and pharyngeal swabs, and subsequently extended to blood and other sample types.
CON-VINCE aims to fill this gap by providing reliable information on the nature, prevalence and transmission modality of COVID-19 in the Grand Duchy, therefore guiding national and international decision-makers in mounting an effective public health, political and economic response to the pandemic".
In order to put in place effective measures to stave off the COVID-19 infection, it is crucial to systematically test a representative sample of the population in order to identify all individuals carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regardless of their symptoms.
and those who were infected but are at present free of the virus.
Claude Meisch, minister of Higher Education and Research: "Thanks to the task force that was launched two weeks ago, the public research institutions in Luxembourg have joined forces in the fight against COVID-19 and can provide valuable support and knowledge to help us make data-based decisions.
Prof. Rejko Krüger (Director of Transversal Translational Medicine at the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH) and coordinator of the "CON-VINCE" study): "To the best of our knowledge, asymptomatic carriers are not systematically monitored in any of the countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this context, "CON-VINCE" has been launched today with the aim of testing a panel of approximately 1,500 participants over the age of 18 and detecting the three main groups of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people.
The "CON-VINCE" study is led by a consortium of Luxembourgish research institutions, including LIH and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) of the University of Luxembourg.
Panel participants will be recruited by TNS Ilres and tested for SARS-CoV-2 through a specific molecular biology technique.
Paulette Lenert, minister of Health: "The CON-VINCE study represents the logical next step of the extensive testing of our population to better prevent the spread of the virus.
However, they currently remain largely unassessed, since diagnostic testing is performed predominantly on people with clear COVID-19 symptoms.
Prof. Ulf Nehrbass (Chief Executive Officer at LIH and spokesperson of the Research Luxembourg COVID-19 task force): "In parallel, the project will also allow us to track the psychological and socio-economic impact of long-term containment measures on the general population and help us define clearer timeframes for lifting the current stringent confinement strategies".

Research Luxembourg is a joint initiative of the main players in Luxembourg public research, Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH); Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER); Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST); Laboratoire national de santé (LNS); Luxinnovation; University of Luxembourg; Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR), under the coordination of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research.
Participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 but displaying mild or no symptoms will be followed up over one year, together with virus-free individuals.
It will test about 1,500 people for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and follow-up only the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals.
individuals who are "virus-free" and therefore asymptomatic;
Given the limited number of students affected by this measure, compliance with strict barrier measures seems manageable.

In order to avoid spreading among the general population and to protect vulnerable and fragile populations, it is important to take a certain number of precautions.
Certificates issued by health authorities of other European countries for quarantine measure are also recognized in Luxembourg.
The person in question benefits from an absence of work certificate, equivalent to a sickness certificate, issued up by the Health Inspectorate and recognized by the health insurance.
Therefore, a case in Luxembourg is a likely scenario but authorities and health services are ready to take in charge, care for and isolate these patients.
A referral service, namely the National Service of Infectious Diseases at CHL, is in charge of the reception of patients infected with the coronavirus.
Throw the tissue in a bin with a lid.
If necessary, isolation may be imposed by the Health Inspectorate if, for example, the patient refuses isolation or its therapeutic treatment.
Isolation is usually done in a hospital, but can also be realized at home. For the duration of the illness, the patient benefits from a sick leave equivalent to a sickness certificate issued by the attending physician.
Moreover, they should refrain from visiting vulnerable people.

Press release by the Ministry of Health, the Office of the High Commissioner for National Protection and the Crisis Communication Service
After having developed symptoms of the coronavirus COVID-19, the person contacted, in accordance with the recommendations issued by the Health Directorate, the health authorities in order to undergo a diagnostic test.
Following the appearance of a first case of a person infected with the COVID-19 disease, the Prime Minister convened, in consultation with the Minister of Health and the High Commissioner for National Protection, the "Pandemic" crisis unit.
In general, please refer to www.gouvernement.lu for further information on the coronavirus and precautionary measures.
This telephone psychological support service is therefore offered to all those who feel the need.
The hotline 8002 8080 set up in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak now offers multilingual psychological support, seven days a week, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
In a period of containment linked to the COVID-19 epidemic, many people in crisis, anxiety or discomfort find themselves alone facing their questions and uncertainties.
It is operated by highly qualified teams prepared to guide a person in distress, by teleconsultation.
Also in this context, the website https://suivicovid.lu/ has been set up, providing access to the solution in 5 languages.
As of 9 April 2020, 388 patients have been accompanied in their convalescence at home by this new tool.
As a result, the platform now has almost 600 registered doctors, more than 4,000 registered patients and almost 3,000 teleconsultations already carried out.
The teleconsultation solution, hosted on a recognised Luxembourg platform, has been up and running for two weeks.
These often relate to good teleconsultation practices or the functioning of the teleconsultation solution.
The second part of the tutorial explains how to make a medical appointment.
The follow-up, carried out by a team of professionals from the Health Directorate, thus makes it possible to identify a possible need for assistance or a worsening of the patient's situation.
This document, which is intended for both, health professionals and patients, will be published on the sites of the entities that contributed to the drafting of the document.
With the increasing use of this new practice, health professionals and patients alike are asking many questions.
Nearly 390 coronavirus patients monitored by the MAELA telemonitoring tool
As soon as the patient is voluntarily enrolled in this national telemonitoring system (carried out by the hospital at the time of discharge, or by the Health Inspection after receipt of positive laboratory results), the patient must answer a short medical questionnaire on a daily basis for 2 weeks.
Since 30 March 2020, the remote monitoring tool for COVID-19 patients, MAELA, has been operational throughout Luxembourg.
Together they have also developed a tutorial for patients which, in 4 parts, explains how to use the teleconsultation platform.
In the current emergency situation, teleconsultation is a key element in the organisation of the health system set up in Luxembourg during the COVID-19 pandemic, because it limits travel as well as human-to-human contacts and therefore the risks of contamination.
Every day, the number of appointments between health care professionals and patients increases.
This system allows remote monitoring of all patients who test positive for COVID-19; both those who are in isolation at home and those who have just been discharged from hospital.
Better understanding of the teleconsultation tool in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
It thus makes it possible to limit the spread of the virus and relieve congestion in healthcare structures, while offering patients follow-up by qualified professionals in complete safety.
They first developed a joint explanatory document on the specific rules for teleconsultation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (see annex to this press release).
Selected on behalf of the Health Directorate by a committee of experts representing various health stakeholders, this solution has already been deployed in all hospitals, the Château de Colpach Convalescence Centre and a centralised Health Directorate platform.
To better answer the various questions, the National Health Fund (Caisse nationale de Santé - CNS) and the eSanté Agency, together with the Health Directorate, the Medical College, the Higher Council for Certain Health Professions, the Association of Doctors and Dentists and the Luxembourg Association of Midwives, have set up several initiatives.
As part of the fight against the propagation of the COVID-19 epidemic, the government has commissioned the eSanté Agency to very quickly set up a teleconsultation solution to enable remote consultations between doctors, dentists or midwives and patients.
The first part of the tutorial provides general information and explains how to register on the teleconsultation platform.
Press release by the Ministry of Health, the eSanté and the National Health Fund
Patients can access these tutorials on the CNS and eSanté Agency websites.
Part 3 deals with the conduct of the teleconsultation and part 4 explains what happens after teleconsultation (including the electronic sending of documents).

MANAGEMENT OF THE HEALTH CRISIS
If a visit has to take place, all of the necessary protective measures must be taken in order to protect the patients.
The prohibition does not apply to hotels.
Thus, when these animals are not at home, they can go to the premises to take care of them.
Hospitals will deploy their staff mainly to urgent and acute activities.
The result is also sent to the Health Inspectorate, in application of the law of 1 August 2018 on the compulsory declaration of certain diseases.
This is a national remote monitoring system that allows medical teams to know if you are well or if you may need assistance.
These people in the same household do not need to distance themselves from each other.
However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.
If you have contracted the virus and your state of health allows it, you must stay at home in isolation for two weeks.
Playgrounds are closed.
You will also be invited to be monitored at a distance, by registering voluntarily to the online application "Maela".
What is the gradual exit strategy from confinement?
Every day for two weeks, you are invited to answer a medical questionnaire sent to a team of professionals from the Health Directorate.
The hospital business continuity plan is to be activated.
According to the World Health Organization, the subsequent predominant route of transmission is human-to-human.
Do not go to a physician's office.
This applies to the duration of trips from one household to another.
Leaving your house is restricted to the following activities:
A policy of risk mitigation through confinement has been put in place by the Grand Ducal Regulation of 18 March 2020 with a strong emphasis on the protection of fragile populations at risk of severe complications.

On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 epidemic to be a global pandemic.
If needed, contact your physician via telephone or by teleconsultation eConsult .
Isolation is prescribed by the physician for 14 days after the onset of symptoms.
As a general rule, the gathering of people on public roads is not permitted.
At the patient's request, the result can also be passed on to his/her physician.
Your personal physician is in the best position to assess the value of the test in your case.
A group of people living under the same roof can also pursue outdoor leisure activities.
However, it can be said that a pandemic is the increased and sustained propagation of an extraordinary infectious human disease that rapidly affects all parts of the world and a large part of the global population.
ensure testing capacities and to support research in particular with regard to tests measuring the acquired immunity of the population.
Given that many hospitalised people are vulnerable, visits of hospital patients are prohibited until further notice.
In this context, the website www.suivicovid.lu has been set up.
The offers posted on these pages are regularly updated, don't hesitate to browse through them.
What does an isolation measure mean?
The strategy does not rely on formal preventive quarantine measures anymore, but instead focuses on isolation, auto-isolation and auto-quarantine.
Can a blood test detect the presence of the virus?
This protects you against a variety of common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass from pets to humans.
For all other questions related to COVID-2019, please consult the websites of the Luxembourg Government www.covid19.lu , the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) www.ecdc.eu or the World Health Organization (WHO) www.who.int .
Which protective measures are taken in hospital facilities?
When parents are separated and have visitation and accommodation rights and alternate custody of their children, they are not bound by the travel restrictions for the public.
Stay home. Limit your social contacts to the strict minimum.
The Government's objective is to implement a gradual exit from confinement in phases while remaining cautious to avoid the onset of a second wave of the epidemic.
apply the basic barrier gestures and support them with other specific measures to reduce as far as possible the risk of uncontrolled spread of the virus - including in the workplace,
In order to reduce the risk of the virus circulating in hospitals, medical, surgical and care activities which are not short-term indispensable are cancelled.
Because animals and humans can sometimes share diseases, people with COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets.
The new coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that had not yet been identified in humans.
You will receive two mailings from the Health Directorate (Direction de la santé) within days of the start of your isolation:
This measure is designed to prevent the infected person, who is contagious, from spreading the infection to his surroundings.
How should I behave in order to be as little exposed as possible?
The test result is sent to the physician who requested the test, through a secure channel, who communicates it to the patient without delay.
As more and more cases have appeared in Europe and Luxembourg and as it has become clear that it is impossible to keep the virus from spreading throughout the general population, the control strategy has been adapted.
Whenever possible, leave them with family and friends for the duration of the illness.
No. Only a test on respiratory secretions is currently available to detect the presence of the new coronavirus.
The call also goes out to doctors in the process of specialising, students, retirees and people on leave without pay.

COVID-19 is not a sexually transmitted disease.
Patients with COVID-19 who do not show severe complications (cases with light symptoms) will be cared for at home, while respecting the recommended isolation measures.
However, hotel restaurants and bars, with the exception of room service and take-out, are closed
At this time, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.
On the other hand, they must all respect the two-metre distance from people who do not live with them.
Owners of pets, e.g. cats, dogs, horses, can travel to ensure their well-being.
Droplets can persist for some time on objects or surfaces around the person in question.
Individuals may pursue outdoor leisure activities as long as they remain alone.
During this period of confinement at home, contact with other people must be avoided and a surgical mask must be worn whenever the infected person is in the presence of others.
However, here again, no gathering of people is allowed, the distance of at least 2 metres must be respected.
The prohibition does not apply to take-away, drive-in and home delivery services.

How is COVID-19 coronavirus spread?
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses, i.e. the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
PROTECTION
Establishments receiving the public, activities of a cultural, social, festive, sporting and recreational nature are suspended.
Isolation applies to people who have a confirmed infection with COVID-19.
If the epidemic spreads, other hospitals are also ready to receive patients infected with COVID-19.
Is there a vaccine against COVID-19?
On govjos.lu, you can match your skills and experience to the offers of reinforcement, and communicate your contact details and availability using the online form.
For regulated health professionals, registration is mandatory.
If I am suspected of being infected with COVID-19 and a test was executed, who receives the result of the test?
However, the virus being present in the respiratory secretions and being able to be transmitted by direct contact of person to person, sexual intercourse is favorable to a transmission of the virus, if one of the partners is infected.
Thus, parents and children can e.g. walk around holding hands, parents can carry their child across the street.
Establishments in the cultural, recreational and sports sectors, as well as restaurants and cafés, are closed.
The same applies to company canteens, except where an interpersonal distance of two metres is respected.

Schools will open their doors in stages from May onwards.
Otherwise, they must respect the requirement of a distance of two metres between people.
A laboratory test carried out on medical prescription can identify the SARS-CoV-2 nfection.
A referral service, namely the National Service of Infectious Diseases at the CHL, is in charge of the reception of patients infected with the coronavirus.
This platform also seeks to coordinate the call for volunteers who wish to support health-related efforts (e.g. administrative officers, educators, carers, cleaning agents) and lists the specific needs.
In order to delay spreading among the general population and to protect vulnerable and fragile groups in the population, it is important to take a certain number of precautions.
Volunteers are recruited via the platform www.govjobs.lu .

The cell reviewed the decisions taken by the Government Council this morning.
The service has been strongly demanded in recent days, with more than 650 calls per day.
Finally, the exchange made it possible to analyse the current and future operation of the 8002 8080 hotline.
The authorities will continue to monitor developments closely and inform the public on a regular basis on developments and new measures.
Discussions also focused, on the one hand, on increasing accommodation capacity for sick people in case of need and, on the other hand, on business continuity plans with the State.
In this context, the members of the unit had an exchange of views on the protection of fragile populations at risk of severe complications.
Press release by the Ministry of Health / Office of the High Commissioner for National Protection / Crisis Communication Service
Faced with the gradual spread of the virus in our country and in our neighbouring regions, the crisis unit has prepared the gradual transition from the containment strategy to the implementation of additional measures.
The public is invited to consult the FAQs available on the website www.gouvernement.lu/coronavirus for further information on the coronavirus and precautionary measures.
The crisis unit met under the chairmanship of the Minister of Health Paulette Lenert and brought together all the ministries and administrations involved in the subject in question, to take stock of the situation and to take measures adapted to the evolution of the situation in Luxembourg and in Europe.
The Prime Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Health and the High Commissioner for National Protection, has convened the "Pandemic" crisis unit.

The test will be reserved for serious or complicated cases.
On 12 March 2020, the Prime Minister, Minister of State, Xavier Bettel, convened an extraordinary Government Council dedicated to measures to tackle the spread of the Coronavirus.
In this context, the concept of a risk zone is no longer relevant to define an indication for testing.
From now on, it will have to focus more on dealing with serious cases and protecting vulnerable people.
The schools will remain open on Friday 13 March 2020, with a view to explaining these measures to teachers and pupils.
All persons entering the premises must disinfect their hands and respect the general rules of hygiene.
It is recommended that sports, cultural and leisure associations suspend their activities for children during the same period.
The frequency of public transport is being adapted following the suspension of school transport.

Given that very vulnerable and often multi-morbid people are staying in these facilities, the following recommendations are issued until further notice:
In order to avoid prolonged close contact with the driver, the first two rows in the buses have to remain free of passengers.
Go shopping outside of peak hours, if possible;
In the light of the evolution of the virus COVID-19 in Luxembourg, which has resulted in a significant increase in cases in the last 24 hours and the first cases of local transmission, the government has taken a series of new measures and issued recommendations with a view to protecting public health.
Meals-on-wheels will be maintained.
Home office should be promoted as far as possible and preferably among the vulnerable population.
Teaching structures
Reception facilities (Crèches, Drop-in centres (Maisons relais), parental assistants; Youth Centres; the University of Luxembourg; the National Institute for Languages and Adult Learning).
The following measures have been taken:
All activities of education and care services will be suspended.
Prohibition of visits and recommendation to avoid outings, except for staff and external providers on condition that they do not present symptoms (cough, fever, breathing difficulties).
This suspension also applies to private schools, Drop-in centres (Maisons relais) and public and private crèches.
For these individuals, the following recommendations apply:
State-approved care homes and accommodation facilities for the elderly
Auto-quarantine: Any person who has been in direct or close contact (&lt;2m, more than 15 minutes) with a confirmed case of infection shall self-quarantine at home for 7 days, followed by a 7-day period of self-surveillance (resumption of normal activities, but monitoring body temperature twice a day, or coughing, difficulty breathing).
Scheduled activities should be cancelled, if possible.
Directors of structures may allow, in exceptional cases, exceptions from the prohibition of access and exit for relatives and family members, provided that they do not show symptoms.
Avoid large events and gathering spaces, confined spaces, large crowds (at cinemas, concert halls, sports venues) and places where you are not able to keep a security distance of at least 1 to 2 metres;
This measure applies to:
Events in non-confined spaces with more than 500 people are prohibited
Activities in daycare centres can be maintained.
Field trips are cancelled with immediate effect.
Events in confined spaces with more than 100 people are prohibited
Auto-isolation: Any patient with symptoms compatible with an acute respiratory infection (possible CoV-2-SARS infection) should self-isolate at home for the duration of symptoms, followed by a period of 24 hours after the symptoms have disappeared Testing is no longer necessary if symptoms remain mild.
If possible, the leaves of hospital staff should be cancelled if such action becomes necessary in the light of changing circumstances.
Individuals are considered vulnerable if they are over 65 years of age or if they are already suffering from one of the conditions mentioned hereafter.
If a visit has to take place, all of the necessary protective measures must be taken in order to protect the patients.
Residential schools;
Those conditions are:
If possible, stay home!
Keep a distance of 2 meters.
The government's strategy
• when you're feeling sick;
Nevertheless, the number of new infections remains high and vigilance of the entire population is therefore required.
Instructions for use
said Dr. Mike Ryan, a WHO emergency expert, at a press conference.
• Wash your mask every day and at a minimum temperature of 60°.
• when one wishes to contribute to the common effort to contain the virus;
These masks should also be worn by people who are in contact with vulnerable people to protect them.
Wash your hands with soap and water.
• in public places where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Its conformity with the provisions of the Directive is attested by the CE marking on the packaging, which guarantees quality and safety.
Such a strategy was indeed necessary in the context of a limited national reserve and the absence of vaccine and treatment against COVID-19.
It is apparent from the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 for Luxembourg that the confinement policy decided by the government is beginning to show its first effects.
Avoid touching your face with your hands.
This mask is not suitable for doctors and caregivers, but for the general public in certain situations, such as:
The mask is a medical device covered by Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices.
Strict compliance with sanitary precautionary measures has been emphasized as an essential corollary to these measures.
In line with the recommendations of the health authorities, the strategy aims first and foremost to protect the doctors and carers who are on the front line in our fight against the virus.
• Position the mask so that it covers the mouth and nose.
They are regulated by the European Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment and must comply with standards (K)N95, EN 149, type FFP2 or FFP3, which guarantee quality and safety.
It can thus help to prevent transmission of the virus by people who are unknowingly carriers of the virus and help to slow the spread of the virus.
Who can use the alternative masks?
The targeted populations and the instructions for use will be gradually adapted into account the evolution of the epidemiological situation and the available resources.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is capable of being transmitted even in the absence of symptoms.
However, beware of a false sense of security, as there is no scientific proof that this mask protects against respiratory viruses.
The Health Directorate has complemented these measures with a strategy for the management and use of masks from the national supply.
In addition, the ECDC has produced a document aimed at providing guidance on the wearing of alternative masks, as an option in case of a shortage of specialized masks.
What are "alternative" masks?
A tutorial for making masks has been worked out to support the #BitzDoheem project, which is organised by the FNEL and the "Lëtzebuerger Guiden a Scouten", with logistical support from the POST and for which volunteers can register via GovJobs.
It is therefore advisable to cover your mouth and nose with a mask or even another piece of cloth, especially in public places where keeping interpersonal distance is difficult to maintain.
Respiratory masks known as "FFP2" are worn in case of protection in a context of aerial transmission.
They do not protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they do protect others when the person wearing the mask is infected, even if they do not show symptoms.
They protect the caregiver more effectively in the event of aerosol production by an infected patient during intubation procedures, naso- or oropharyngeal smears, respiratory physiotherapy, dental care, opening of the ventilation circuit, endotracheal suctioning, etc.
Given the pathogenic and virulent nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic, the government decided, on 15 March 2020, to put in place restrictions on the movement of the population in order to reduce the spread of the virus, protect people at risk and preserve the capacity of our health care system.
In a guidance document published on 6 April 2020, WHO provides advice on the use of masks, including by healthy people.
• After touching or removing the mask, wash your hands thoroughly.
Caution: The mask does not replace other sanitary precautionary measures, whose strict application remains the most effective measure to stop the spread of the virus.
But the idea of using respiratory coverings or mouth covering to prevent coughing and wheezing from projecting the disease into the environment and towards others (...) that in itself is not a bad."
So-called "alternative" or "non-medical" masks can be homemade fabric masks or a simple cloth covering the mouth and nose.
The following rules must be followed when wearing an alternative mask:
In the absence of a vaccine or treatment against COVID-19, adherence to sanitary precautionary measures is more important than ever, especially since delays in the supply of surgical masks and FFP2 respiratory masks are likely to continue for several more weeks.
This type of mask helps hold back the droplets that are spread when by talking, sneezing or coughing.
Attach it carefully to limit the appearance of gaps between the face and the mask.
In a statement dated 1 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) paved the way for increased use of masks, including hand-made masks, by the general public in order to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
Wearing masks made of fabric that do not comply with the applicable standards can therefore be justified in the event of a tense supply situation and provided that the mask in question is used as a complement to other precautionary measures.
COVID-19 PANDEMIC: WEARING A MASK AS ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE
"Alternative" masks are to be distinguished from so-called surgical masks and respiratory masks "FFP2", which are primarily reserved for physicians and caregivers.
"We must preserve medical and surgical respiratory masks for frontline staff only.
• When removing the mask, do not touch the front part, but undo it from the back.
Surgical masks are fluid resistant and are worn in case of a possible exposure to droplets or secretions, including during surgery.
• Avoid touching your mask while wearing it.
Cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the crease of the elbow.

The group will be composed of the following people:
A final decision will be taken in due course by the Government Council on the basis of an analysis of the situation.
Thus, the deconfinement strategy consists of:
ensuring the isolation and close follow-up of new cases of infection;
Companies, businesses and administrations are generally encouraged to continue to promote teleworking throughout the transition period out of confinement.
Beyond these regulatory prohibitions, educational activities and the activity of the recycling centres have been suspended.
Reopening of recycling centres.
However, the government has decided to proceed only with a cautious lifting of the confinement measures.

At this stage, however, it is premature to give a detailed assessment of the lifting of restrictions in this sector.
Workers belonging to the vulnerable category may consult their doctor to determine whether the severity of the illness prevents them from going to work.
The resumption of activities can therefore only take place in successive phases that are well thought out in terms of impact.
The first phase thus covers the following activities:
In the Grand Duchy, the rate of new infections shows a downward trend and thus reflects the effect sought by the confinement measures put in place on 16 March 2020.
This list will be completed on 4 May by the resumption of senior classes, as well as internships and practical work at BTS and university level.
The confinement measures currently in place for vulnerable persons and persons over 65 years of age will continue to be in force at least until the end of the first phase.
This will be followed - in later phases - by the resumption of commercial activities and the reopening of the HORECA sector.
Gatherings will remain prohibited until 31 July, except for funerals and civil weddings, which will be allowed for a maximum of 20 people and provided that an interpersonal distance of 2 metres is respected.
This assessment must be done on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the recommendations of the Health Directorate and the working environment of the person concerned.
making the population aware of its responsibilities and to reduce as far as possible the risk of uncontrolled spread by maintaining, or even strengthening, the barrier measures to be observed in any place where people congregate;
developing testing capacities and support research in particular with regard to serological tests to measure the acquired immunity of the population.
Erny Gillen - Expert in ethics
ensuring, at all times, sufficient hospital capacities in normal and intensive care to be able to handle serious cases in health care institutions;
The gradual lifting of the current restrictions also entails the need to develop, in consultation with the Ministry of Family Affairs, Integration and the Greater Region a strategy for the protection of vulnerable persons in care centres and persons over 65 years of age.
Nora Back - President of the Chamber of Employees
It is important to note that any resumption of activities will be accompanied by very strict barrier gestures and complemented by the mandatory wearing of a mask or any other device that covers the nose and mouth for interpersonal contact situations if the safety distance of 2 metres cannot be guaranteed.
At its meeting of 15 April 2020, the Government Council set up an ad hoc group to accompany the measures decided as part of the fight against the virus and to assess on a regular basis the side effects of these measures and the confinement.
Alexa Ballmann - President of the JHL (Jonk Handwierk)
On 15 April 2020, the Government Council fixed the guidelines for a deconfinement strategy balanced between public health imperatives and the psycho-social and economic aspects of the current confinement.
The prohibitions laid down in Article 2 of the amended Grand Ducal Regulation of 18 March introducing a series of measures in the context of the fight against COVID-19 will be maintained.

It is also clear that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health may submit to the Government Council at any time a proposal to reintroduce stricter confinement measures when, on the basis of the monitoring of the evolution of the situation, it appears that hospital capacities are likely to reach a critical level which could jeopardise the proper care of patients.
As a reminder, the amended Grand Ducal Regulation of 18 March introducing a series of measures in the context of the fight against COVID-19 introduced restrictions or even prohibitions on commerce and artisanal activitiesincluding the closure of construction sites, to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The decision to launch a phase is taken by the Government on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, and it is based on close monitoring of the evolution of the number of newly infected people in the population and an estimate of available hospital capacity in the short and medium term.

the Grand Duke, members of the Grand Duke's family and the government will attend the festivities organised in Esch-sur-Alzette, Larochette and Luxembourg City on 22 and 23 June 2018.
The economic mission to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), chaired by HRH the Hereditary Grand Duke and led by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Economy, Étienne Schneider, and in the presence of the Minister of Finance, Pierre Gramegna, concluded with a day dedicated to Luxembourg's presence at Expo 2020 Dubai, which will take place from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021.
Thank you so much for your attention!"
The aim of this conference was to identify learning points arising from the Ebola epidemic which will be crucial to strengthen health security in the European Union, better prepare us for similar crises and put us in the position to respond rapidly, flexibly and effectively to emergencies and disease outbreaks in the future.

And we need to learn from this epidemic how to be better prepared in case of the next international health crisis.
12 new COVID-19 infections in Luxembourg
Let me address my special thanks to MSF for their relentless efforts in the fight against Ebola.
Visits of hospital patients are prohibited.
the Grand Duke has honourably discharged, by his own request, Étienne Schneider, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Economy, Minister of Health.
You are going to find all the necessary information about the new coronavirus on the government website: www.covid19.lu
A month ago a high-level conference on Ebola focused on lessons to be learned to improve preparedness and response in the EU for future outbreaks.
As concerns the national commitment:
And second, efforts at European level in the framework of the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Council.
• You and your environment have to wash their hands regularly using water and soap for at least 20 seconds.
Thus, a flight organised by the government of Luxembourg in cooperation with Luxembourg Air Rescue (LAR) transported a British national from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom for assessment and monitoring.
2nd COVID-19 infection in Luxembourg
It allowed all relevant actors to test the applicability status of Decision 1082 on serious cross-border threats to health, exactly two years after its publication.
The intervention of German minister Hermann Gröhe on the discussions at the G7 on Ebola was a most timely and valuable input to our reflections.
and that we integrate migrant and refugee health matters into national and EU policies.
I am looking forward to welcoming you to the next meeting of your Committee in 2016.
the role of health in the European semester
We don't know when the next epidemic will hit us, but we know for sure that cross-sectoral cooperation is crucial if we want to strengthen health security within the European Union and to improve the response and preparedness capacities of Member States in case of future outbreaks.

Press release by the Ministry of Health, the Office of the High Commissioner for National Protection and the Crisis Communication Service
I do not work.
But this is not possible for logistical / practical reasons.
That means, they are defined by the government.
That gives reason to be optimistic.
It is true that Luxembourg has mastered the crisis well so far.
The solidarity and discipline of the entire population play an important role here.
Can a second wave be prevented this way?
Please contact your family doctor or a Center de Soins Avancés.
Procedure and time frame
Is that all only about scaremongering right now?
The extensive testing started on May 18, 2020.
This is possible because overall, still relatively few positive cases are expected at this point.
I could be infectious without knowing it.
Do I no longer have to comply with the hygien regulations?
The contigents therefore go beyond national borders.
You don't have to do anything right now.
The test strategy does not mean 100% protection for all of us.
By June 1, 2020, the capacities will then be continuously increased to up to 20,000 tests per day.
My colleague has already eceived a letter, but I have not.
What do the contingents look like?
Contingents are allocated according to the government's exit strategy.
There are 17 drive-in and 2 walk-in / bike-in stations across the country.
In theory, of course, it would be better if everyone could be tested every day.
More information can be found here .
Mortality at COVID-19 is currently estimated to be around 0.7%.
And the test strategy clearly contributes to this - this is scientifically undisputed.
Our health system then again risks being in a critical situation in which not everyone could be adequately treated.
As a result, there are very few false negative results.
The following also applies here: Having a test is above all a protection for others.
At the beginning of the pandemic, we already had a high level of infection in Luxembourg compared to the size of the population.
First of all, people who are in contact with others because of their work are tested.
Without vaccination or medication, the coronavirus will hardly be manageable.
Please stay at home for two weeks and follow the instructions given by the health authority to protect others.
This can be done manually (as is currently the case in Luxembourg) or with the additional help of an app.
I.e. a few individual cases can quickly turn into hundreds, thousands of cases.
Ultimately, many people would die in a short time.
The economic impact of the lockdown is noticeable per month in relation to the gross domestic product with an average loss of approximately 3,200 EUR per inhabitant of Luxembourg.
So far (status: May 7, 2020), 500,000 tests have been purchased from Fast Track Diagnostics at a total price of 4.7 million euros.
This means that almost 1 million tests can be carried out during the next 2 months.
With this method, the efficiency and thus the capacity of large-scale testing can be increased while maintaining the same quality.
But any measure that helps prevent new infections improves the situation and public health.
Such an approach, without taking any protective measures, would result in a large number of deaths in a short time.
Still, we'll have to live with the virus until a vaccine is developed.
However, the extensive testing is carried out according to a specific time schedule.
Who is tested regularly?
Thanks to the pooling method, over 1.7 million tests can be carried out with these tests.
What should I do?
Are all the contingents tested only once?
For the individual, a negative test result does not mean, of course, that the person no longer has to adhere to the usual hygiene measures.
Pooling means that 4 tests are evaluated at the same time.
So far, all people have had little contact with others in the lockdown.
Is the large-scale test strategy a research project?
One option is to strictly limit physical contacts between people, as was the case in lockdown.
In general, COVID-19 PCR tests have improved a lot in the past few weeks and have increased their sensitivity significantly.
I feel sick , should I now be examined as part of the large-scale testing?
What happens to my data?
I have already been tested and my test was negative .
However, there is a concept behind the test strategy (see above) that offers the greatest possible protection for everyone if as many people as possible take part (see question: Is the test voluntary or not?)
So far, only people with symptoms have been tested.
Do I need prescription / referral from a doctor for the test?
The test strategy is not about creating panic; on the contrary, it is about introducing an additional measure that will allow us to regain a little more normality faster and more safely.
Therefore, they are included in the corresponding contingents and are also invited to be tested.
How many test from which company have already been purchased?
How can the virus be kept under control?
But we must not forget that without security measures, the virus spreads exponentially.
The more than 200,000 cross-border commuters in Luxembourg make up an important part of the Luxembourg's work environment.
Should you need further assistance to make an appointment or encounter any technical issue please contact our hotline at the following number : (+352) 28 55 83-1.
The project is led the Luxembourg Institute of Health.
No, the tests are free for the participants.
Are the costs of up to 39.5 million euros for the entire large-scale testing justified?
In a statement by the National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) on the coronavirus crisis of March 13, 2020 (see http://www.cnpd.lu ), it explicitly confirmed that the health authority may collect and process this personal data.
The personnel who perform the tests are trained and wear protective clothing and a mask.
What do I have to take with me when I go to my test appointment?
If you simply let the virus spread its course, many people would get sick at the same time and the health system would be overloaded (capacity in hospitals, etc.).
At the same time, the virus is very contagious, much more than, for example, influenza flu.
The test costs per person are therefore relatively low in order to achieve an early and safe loosening of the lockdown.
The budget for carrying out the large-scale testing was provided by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education.
More information for people with COVID-19 can be found here.
Large-scale testing is not just about the individual, but mainly about the population as a whole.
If we now ran large-scale antibody tests, we would only get a very, very large number of negative results and thus waste a large amount of resources.
It does not matter whether there are symptoms of COVID-19 or not.
Yes, children are included in the extensive testing and, like adults, will receive an invitation by post.
What about herd immunity?
This should be avoided so that we don't have to go back into a lockdown.
At the same time, however, it can also be recognized at an early stage when a potential second wave is forming, which in the worst case would result in a lockdown - which should be avoided
According to a detailed time schedule, contingents are tested either entirely, in subgroups or in representative samples.
Only when a possible immunity is widespread in the population does this have a significant effect on the spread of the virus.
This means that we are still far away from herd immunity, which would only have been reached at around 60 %.
Whether a contingent is tested completely and how often it depends on various factors:
The tests are carried out by its contractual partner Laboratoire Reunis, who is logistically supported by Ecolog.
The researchers have at no point access to the personal data of the people tested.
What data is collected during the tests?
More information about the two tests can be found in this article (DE/FR).
If the pooled analysis is positive, all 4 samples are checked again separately.
Even with testing, the virus will probably not disappear completely.
That means they carry the virus within themselves without developing symptoms but can still infect other people.
SARS-CoV-2 infections are among these notifiable diseases (Loi du 1er août 2018 sur la declaration obligatoire de certaines maladies).
The mentioned large-scale testing project is - as far as the test itself is concerned - a project by different players from Luxembourg research, but not a research project.
How high is the prevalence (percentage of infections in the tested group) in a representative sample of the contingen
In sectors in which not a whole contingent is tested, but (first) a representative group within the contingent, these people are selected at random.
My result was negative.
People who are at high risk of contracting an infection or are in contact with many other people are tested every two weeks.
So, they don't know that they can carry the virus and pass it on.
In addition, the drive-through concept at most test stations prevents you from coming into contact with other people, since the swab is carried out while you are sitting in the car.
For people with COVID-19 symptoms, the instructions from the health inspection department continue to apply.
Gradually, more contingents will be invited for testing.
If you are asked to be tested and still decide against it, it does not mean that you have to stay at home.
How many people can be tested from when?
The large-scale testing is based on the proactive mitigation strategy developed by the Research Luxembourg COVID-19 Task Force.
Can everybody be voluntarily tested or chosen within a contingent or does the task force randomly select the people to be tested?
And why isn't everyone in a contingent tested directly?
A good monitoring system also helps to keep the virus under control.
Among other things, this allows to contact the positive cases by phone, isolate them and track their contacts (contact tracing).
It is a contribution to public health in which public-law research institutions make their knowledge and expertise available to accompany political decisions.
The SMS contains a code with which you can download your results on a website.
The risk of getting infected during the test is extremely small.
We have to assume that the increased contacts will lead to more infections.
This can either be done manually by employees of the health inspection department or supported by digital methods such as apps.
It is therefore important to keep an eye on the relevant figures such as the number of reproductions, but also to monitor the number of freely available intensive care beds, the number of new infections, the age of the newly infected, etc.
Simulations assume several thousand deaths within a few weeks in Luxembourg.
The PCR test used in the large-scale testing has a sensitivity of 100 %, so that even the smallest amounts of virus can be detected.
In addition, we now know that the majority of infected people show no symptoms (an estimated 80 % of those infected).
How many there will be depends on how well everyone adheres to the hygiene measures and how many people can be tested.
Such a test would also primarily identify people who have already had an infection in the past.
Are children tested too?
What is contact tracing and what role does it play un the test strategy?
According to the law, medical laboratories are obliged to report contagious diseases to the health authority (Direction de la sante).
Isn't there a risk of getting infected during the test?
What do I have to do?
If the result is positive, you will also be contacted by the health inspection department and asked to stay at home for two weeks so as not to infect your fellow citizens.
Large-scale antibody tests would only make sense from then on.
This is particularly important for professional groups with a lot of personal contact (e.g. nurses, hairdressers, etc.), as they could pass on the infection to a particularly large number of people through their work.
At this moment, the first steps of the large-scale test strategy focus on the working population and students.
When and how do I get my test results?
Please be patient and get tested as soon as you receive an invitation.
In Luxembourg, contact tracing is currently carried out manually by the health authority.
Performing a PCR test, you do not know whether this person has already had the virus.
The genetic material of the virus can be detected using the PCR test.
On the part of the health authority, only employees of the health inspection (inspection sanitaire), which is a department of the health authority, have access to the confidential data.
When you receive a letter depends on the time schedule developed for the large-scale testing and the contingent to which you are assigned to.
This affects e.g. people who work in the healthcare, police, daycare, hairdressing, and cosmetic sectors.
However, as soon as the contacts increase again, the likelihood of infecting others increases.
The COVID-19 PCR test tells you if you are contagious to others.
You will receive an invitation by mail from the government in collaboration with the Luxembourg Institute of Health to be tested.
It is therefore not a question of a single person no longer being able to be infected, but of reducing the overall risk.
It is also important to trace the contacts of identified people and to quarantine them as a precaution.
The government is providing anonymized, aggregated data sets to public-law research institutions in order to statistically monitor the progress of the pandemic and to evaluate it for research purposes.
It is important for everyone - also for people with a negative test result - to keep to the usual protective gestures (distance of 2 m, protective mask, wash hands etc.).
This is also present when the infected person shows no symptoms.
And the point in this phase of lifting the initial restrictions is to reduce the number of new infections to a minimum.
If the measures are relaxed, the number of infections could rise again quickly.
As soon as your test results are available, you will receive an SMS on the mobile phone number that you specified when registering.
Testing helps to identify asymptomatic virus carriers that in consequence stay at home for 2 weeks.
The tests are therefore also suitable for finding asymptomatic virus carriers.
Nothing.
This makes it easier to predict how high the risk is in order to allow the loosening of as many restrictions as possible.
Where are the tests conducted?
What is the benefit of getting myself tested?
FAQ COVID-19 Large-Scale Testing
If you let yourself be tested and follow the instructions of the health department, you will help to protect your family, friends, colleagues and last but not least the risk groups - and thus keep the spread of the virus under control.
They help to further reduce the risk of infection significantly.
What happens if I don't want to take the test?
My test result was positive.
In this way, each individual can help to identify infection chains at an early stage and protect their family, friends, work colleagues and especially risk groups from potential infection.
The protective measures continue to apply to everyone: wash hands, keep distance, wear mask (where necessary), sneeze and cough etiquette etc.
This can currently be most reliably determined using a throat swab and PCR.
There are several strategies to keep the novel corona virus under control:
As soon as the percentage of infected people in a representative sample rises again, one can test again on a large scale to further minimize the risk.
As soon as you receive an invitation by letter, you can make an appointment for the test.
No. You will receive an invitation by post to be tested.
Yes.
According to the CON-VINCE study, in addition to the currently confirmed cases, there are still around 1,500 people who carry the virus but are asymptomatic (status: May 7, 2020).
Are the antibody -based tests also planned?
The data are obtained from accredited diagnostic laboratories using diagnostic kits and examined in the laboratory.
If antibodies can be detected in the blood sample, this means with a high probability that the test subject has already been infected with the virus.
The laboratories therefore send secure electronic information via the agency e-Sante every day about the people tested (e.g. name, national identification number, address, telephone number and test result).
When registering for the test, personal data is recorded, e.g. your name, national identification number, address and telephone number.
The PCR test can only identify current infections within a certain time window.
High number of work-related contacts (e.g. hairdressers)
Until then, however, the extensive testing allows us to relax the measures more safely and to keep the spread of the virus under control.
Should I get tested again?
No.
Why were only people with symptoms tested at the beginning, and now everyone should be tested?
Do I have to may anything or submit and invoice to the health insurance compagny?
This way many people with current SARS-CoV-2 infections can be identified and isolated - and thus contribute significantly to the success of a normalized life in view of the ongoing pandemic risk.
Which samples are taken for the COVID-19 PCR test?
The majority of those infected show little or no symptoms.
Is the test voluntary or not?
Large-scale antibody tests only make sense if approx. 30 % of the population has already been in contact with the virus.
Shouldn't be as many people as possible be infected with the virus as soon as possible?
When and how can I get tested?
A combination of the above measures to keep the novel corona virus under control is the most effective.
This way, one can avoid new infections.
How reliable is the PCR test?
The data obtained is also forwarded from the test laboratory to the health inspection department in order to notify test subjects who may have tested positive.
However, whether and for how long these antibodies protect against further infection, i.e.
Why are there no large-scale antibody tests currently being carried out?
With each asymptomatic virus carrier that can be identified by the test and then quarantined at home for another two weeks, the risk of infection for everyone else decreases.
High risk of coming into contact with infected people due to work (e.g. nursing staff)
In a further step, however, random samples of the entire population are also invited to be tested.
This prevents them from infecting others and can also inform and enables to test their contacts in order to interrupt the infection chains at an early stage.
This test has a different goal: namely to identify people who have already been infected with the virus and are healthy or on the way to recovery.
Why do comprehensive tests make sense?
Another one is to use tests to identify and isolate those who are virus carriers and therefore infectious.
The more tests we can do, the more infection chains can be interrupted and the lower the number of new infections will be that could lead to a second wave.
What is the difference between antibody tests and PCR tests?
After analyzing the swab, a diagnostic test result is generated: positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Who carries out the large-scale testing?
What is the point of a large-scale testing if I am tested negative today and can still be infected 2 days later?
Antibody tests indicate whether a person has already had the virus and is possibly immune.
Why are large scale PCR tests offered and not large-scale antibody tests?
In order to prevent another lockdown, it is necessary to keep the number of new infections so low that tracing the infection chains remains possible.
On the one hand, the test will of course find out what your own health status is: positive means you are currently infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, negative means you currently have no infection (the test cannot find out whether you have already been in contact with the virus if you are no longer (no longer) infected - only antibody tests can do this).
With an antibody test, on the other hand, you can only determine whether a person has already had an infection, but not necessarily whether it is still current and, above all, whether the test person is still contagious.
Because they allow currently infected people that might infect others to be identified and to then send them home so that they no longer infect other people.
Will I be tested as well?
The CON-VINCE study, in which a representative group of the population was tested for antibodies, showed that currently only about 2% of the population has developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (this is also called ‘seropositive').
Contract tracing means that you understand the contacts of an infected person and ask them to stay at home and / or have themselves tested, in order to interrupt the infection chain.
With the voucher code in the invitation, you can book an appointment within the next two weeks.
For this, a throat swab is carried out using a cotton swab.
However: the more people who can be tested, the better.
A pooling method is used to increase the test capacity.
What kind of test is the PCR test and why can it also detect the virus in asymptomatic people?
View the full list of locations with addresses via this link .
Are cross-border commuters also tested?
Because not all people in a sector or contingent are always tested at the same time, but sometimes representative samples are selected, not all people receive their invitation for testing at the same time, but by post over a period of several weeks.
How long is the voucher valid?
Aren't the number of new infections now manageable?
The tests in conjunction with contact tracing make it possible to break infection chains, and thus reduce new infections.
The PCR test using throat swabs is about identifying and consistently isolating people who are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, i.e. are contagious (as well as people with whom they have been in contact).
The large-scale test strategy is primarily about identifying and isolating asymptomatic people with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection.
AIM OF THE LARGE-SCALE TESTING
Organisation(s)
With the voucher code in this invitation, you can book an appointment at one of our test stations on the website before you go to the test.
The PCR test uses a throat swab and molecular biological techniques to determine whether a current, active SARS-CoV-2 infection is present, i.e. whether the test person is currently carrying the virus and therefore is contagious.
The nationwide test strategy is now about testing people without symptoms in order to identify and isolate these asymptomatic virus carriers.
The test is voluntary.
Testing is of course voluntary.
No blood sample is taken in the test and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
You will receive an SMS with both a positive and a negative test result.
You may have been infected without knowing since the last test result.
However, recent studies show that a majority of those infected show no or hardly any symptoms - so they do not even know that they are positive and therefore contagious.
The antibody test investigates a blood sample is tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
Please show your letter of invitation, your identity card or passport and your insurance card. You will also be asked to provide a mobile phone number during the appointment reservation, on which you will receive an SMS as soon as your test results are available.
Another option is through hygiene measures such as safety distances, wearing face masks and regular and correct washing of the hands.
Nevertheless, the principle of "all or nothing" does not apply here, but quite simply: the more people are tested, the more new infections can be avoided because the tests identify and
WHAT DOES THE STRATEGY CONSIST OF?
FOR INFORMATION: www.covid19.lu
THE EXIT STRATEGY
Foster testing capacities and support research in particular with regard to tests to measure the acquired immunity of the population.
Foresee the possibility of reintroducing stricter measures in the event of a strong resurgence of the virus among the population.
Provide close monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic during the entire exit, as well as the secondary effects of the confinement.
PLEASE STAY AT HOME!
Apply basic barrier gestures and reinforce them with other specific measures, including in the workplace, to minimize the risk of an uncontrolled spread of the virus.
Objective: To gradually phase out the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus while remaining cautious.
Please note that a large number of European countries do not require a negative test.
Please note that all requests that have been previously validated and that concern a departure scheduled between August 3 and September 14 will remain valid.
"Covidtest travels": New procedure for residents who must travel abroad
Given the evolving nature of the situation, citizens are called upon to consult the regular updates of the measures put in place on entry by third countries which will be communicated on the government's websites.
This platform will speed up the process by directing the citizens directly to the form to make an appointment at one of the country's test centres.
At first, the system will only allow appointments to be made for departures in August.
​ Information on the procedures and conditions of eligibility can be found at www.covid19.lu .
To this end, a new procedure will be put in place to make it easier for Luxembourg residents to obtain a COVID-19 test before their departure.
Travelers are also responsible for obtaining information from the competent local authorities (see websites of the embassies of the countries concerned) on the conditions in place at the time of travel.
Thus, from 31 July onwards, citizens are requested to submit their request for a COVID-19 diagnostic test exclusively online via www.covid19.lu .
For business trips, companies can request free tests for their employees travelling to countries that require a negative COVID-19 screening test via the following email address covid19@houseofentrepreneurship.lu .
Following the upsurge of the COVID-19 virus in recent weeks, some countries are asking for a 14-day quarantine or a recent negative COVID-19 test for residents coming from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
In addition, only one test will be granted per identification number ("matricule" - 13-digit social security number).
Therefore, for the summer holiday period, the State offers, one free COVID-19 test per person ahead of a trip or stay abroad - this within the limit of a quota that does not affect strategic testing capabilities.
Opening of Medical centres for patients with coronavirus symptoms
Contaminations and clusters:
It is important to note that the place where the infection is detected does not necessarily correspond to the place of transmission of the infection.
74% of those in quarantine are under the age of 45.
The proportion of symptomatic people decreased from 66% to 58%.
This trend is also reflected in the positivity rate (i.e. the ratio of positive tests to tests performed), which dropped from 0.84% to 0.78%.
Distribution of quarantines by age group:
Non-compliance with quarantines already noted the previous week by health inspectors remains a major problem, as does non-compliance with isolations and is increasingly due to departures on holiday, despite a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.
Although the people concerned are thus rather young on average, it should be noted that the number of COVID-19 positive cases is increasing among people aged 50 and over.
The effective reproductive rate (R) decreased from 1.01 to 0.86 from the previous week.
During this period, 525 new infections and 3,179 contacts were registered, compared to 695 new infections and 3,521 contacts in the previous week.
For the week of 27 July to 2 August, 1,900 people were in quarantine and 1,329 in isolation.
Of the 525 positive cases in the given week, 155 cases were transmitted within families and 82 cases could be linked to clearly identified infection clusters.
As of 2 August, the number of active infections was 1,241 (compared to 1,396 as of 26/07).
During the week in question, there were 6 new deaths related to COVID-19.
During the week of 27 July to 2 August, 3 additional clusters of infections could be identified in health and care facilities, while 4 clusters could be linked to companies with a maximum of 8 cases in one company.
New COVID-19 cases - Weekly review: 27 July - 2 August
For the week of 27 July to 2 August, the average age of those diagnosed as COVID-19 positive is 36 years, and thus remains stable compared to previous weeks.
During the week of 27 July to 2 August, the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 and the number of contacts identified remained stable at a high level.

WHAT RESTRICTIONS REMAIN IN EFFECT?
The compulsory closing at midnight.
WHAT CHANGES WITH PHASE 3 OF DECONFINEMENT?
Establishments of the HORECA sector can reopen under certain conditions, including:
The compulsory wearing of a mask for:
• staff in direct contact with customers;
• customers when they are not seated at their table.
The limitation of 4 people maximum per table.
Sports activities without physical contact or competitive character are allowed.
The spacing of tables placed side by side by a distance of at least 1.5 meters or otherwise by a physical separation to limit the risk of infection.
Wellness activities are prohibited, unless access is limited to 1 person max. or to people from the same household.
Gatherings of people are limited to:
The aim of phase 3 of deconfinement is to broaden the possibilities of gatherings of people in public places and to open a whole series of establishments that welcome the public.
Fairs and shows remain suspended.
Public events are authorized under the double condition of providing assigned seats and respecting a distance of two meters between people.
• Six people when the gathering takes place in a closed place;
Playgrounds and indoor play activities for children remain closed.
• Twenty people when the gathering takes place outdoors and in a public place.
6th and 7th COVID-19 infection in Luxembourg
With this in mind, the following changes have been made:
Press release by the Ministry of State / Ministry of Health
limitation of the number of guests at home to 10 people;
Nevertheless, it is essential to reduce the number of infected people in order not to lose control of the situation.
Generally speaking, the situation is certainly alarming, but it is not, at this stage, comparable to the situation that the country faced in mid-March during the acute phase of the pandemic.
Further adaptations of measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic
On 19 July 2020, in response to the upsurge in the number of people infected with the coronavirus that our country is facing, the Government Council adopted the draft law amending the law of 17 July 2020 introducing a series of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the World Health Organization, the predominant route of transmission remains human-to-human.
SYMPTOMS AND SCREENING
Thus, Luxembourg is taking part in the European trial called "Discovery", launched in six countries to test four treatments.
Some specific treatments are being studied and will be tested in clinical trials.
What does an self-monitoring measure mean?
A medical certificate will attest to the impossibility of wearing the mask.
Obtaining medicines through this channel carries major risks and is prohibited.

It has a negative impact on the environment as the majority of single-use gloves are neither recyclable nor biodegradable.
This is because activities carried out in medical practices are once again allowed, regardless of the nature of the health problem.
It has also become necessary to adapt the organisation of the health care system in order to cope with an increase in the number of people infected with the virus.
How can I participate in the large-scale tests?
Therefore, you do not need to contact the health authorities yourself to apply for participation in the large-scale testing as long as you have not received an invitation.
In order to reduce the risk of the virus circulating in hospitals, medical, surgical and care activities which were not short-term indispensable were cancelled.
Daily status COVID-19: number of PCR tests; persons tested positive; hospitalizations; deaths; pandemic follow-up.
However, following the infection of several cats (particularly in the United States), cat owners are advised to keep them indoors as much as possible and to avoid contact with people who do not live in the same household.

For information on the conduct of visits and outings, interested parties should contact the structure directly.
Avoid close contact with sick people (keep a distance of at least 2 meters).
Is the new coronavirus dangerous for children?
This question is being studied, but so far there is no evidence that people who have recovered from the new coronavirus are immune and protected from a second infection.
In this context, the respect of appropriate distance rules in interpersonal relations is one of the most effective measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Some countries require a 14-day quarantine or a recent negative COVID-19 test from each person coming from the Grand Duchy.
When to wear a mask?
To this day, the coronavirus has not been associated with fetal anomalies or a heightened risk of a premature birth.

Can plastic visors replace masks?
Afterwards, the identified people are informed that they have been in contact with a sick person (the identity of the sick person is only revealed if he or she agrees).
What if I have a health problem?
Based on currently available data, children with chronic conditions in the following categories can be considered potentially vulnerable:
During the seven days following the quarantine, they must self-monitor and wear a mask when in contact with other people.
The serological test carried out by some private laboratories is done by taking a blood sample.
Thus, the professional may wear a visor in combination with the mask or wear an FFP2 mask when taking care of the client.
However, it cannot be ruled out that a child may have a severe form of COVID-19 or that a complication of the disease may occur.
The medical teleconsultation is well established, do not hesitate to privilege this mode of remote consultation.
Compliance with these measures is also essential to enable restaurants, cafes, bars, consumer lounges and company canteens to function.

The proposed measures take into account the pathogenic and contagious nature of the COVID-19 virus.
Can I have my children tested in Luxembourg?
To help you plan your travels in Europe, the European Commission has launched the Re-open EU platform https://reopen.europa.eu/en/ providing real-time information on borders, available means of transport, travel restrictions, public health and safety measures (e.g. physical distancing or wearing a mask), as well as other practical information for travellers.
Persons with special needs, who, because of their disability, cannot wear a mask, do not fall under this obligation, provided that they put other sanitary measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus.
Kawasaki disease, as well as other complications exceptionally described in COVID-19 children, are known to pediatricians and can be treated in Luxembourg.
Therefore, the World Health Organization believes that issuing "immune passports" to people who have antibodies may provide a false sense of security and thus contribute to the spread of the pandemic.
Travelers are also responsible for obtaining information from the competent local authorities (see websites of the embassies of the countries concerned) and their accommodation structures on the terms in force at the time of travel.
In this context, for the summer holiday period, the State offers one free COVID-19 test per person before travelling or staying abroad.
These persons must stay at home for 7 days counting from the day of the last contact with the infected person - the Health Inspectorate will provide them, if necessary, with a certificate of incapacity for work.
In this case, you are asked to go to your appointment alone, if possible, and to keep to the set schedule to avoid contact with other patients in the waiting room.
A professional will make sure that you do not have any signs of COVID-19.
For contacts respecting the protective measures a self-monitoring period of 14 days is sufficient.
This is why the World Health Organization considers that the widespread use of masks in the whole population is only justified if other preventive measures are impossible or difficult to implement.
On the other hand, to guarantee the airtightness of the FFP2 mask - used by healthcare professionals - the beard must not protrude beyond the outlines of the mask.
What does a quarantine measure mean?
Your physician will then be able to quickly assess whether it is better for you to go to his practice or to be reoriented towards another form of care.

Failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine from 25 to 500 euros.
On arrival, you will be asked to disinfect your hands and to put the surgical mask at your disposal.
Can I still visit elderly people in a care facility?
Make sure to get tested 5 days after said contact; if the test results are negative, the quarantine can be lifted on day 7.
According to this appreciation, the risk of severe complications for elderly people and people with a chronic condition is high.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that no medications, including antibiotics, should be self-medicated to prevent or cure COVID-19.

avoid places where it is not possible to keep a security distance of at least 2 metres;
In case of doubt, medical advice will help to establish the diagnosis and to determine the course of treatment.
Handmade cloth masks, scarves or bandanas may on the other hand be worn more often, as long as they are washed at 60 degrees every day after use.
As soon as you become aware that a sick person is in your home, encourage him or her to leave the premises and to contact a doctor without delay.
In Europe and the United States, deaths caused by COVID-19 among children remain the exception, and in these cases, the children were mostly suffering from a pre-existing condition, exposing them to an increased risk.
Thus, PCR test results regarding a Covid19 infection must be sent to the Health Inspectorate Division within one day.
Visitors belonging to the category of vulnerable persons will not be able to go to the hospital for a visit, unless a duly motivated authorisation is given by their doctor.
These tests can detect antibodies caused by a previous infection, thus confirming the appearance of acquired immunity (IgA, IgG) at the end of the infection, and make a retroactive diagnosis.
Staff members who are in contact with clients must keep their masks on throughout their service.
Seniors and people with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable and at risk of complications.
You will be invited by mail to get tested.
You can then go on a voluntary basis to one of the 17 test stations to perform PCR test by throat swab.
Loss of sense of smell (anosmia) and/or taste, digestive problems as well as skin rashes, are other symptoms of the disease.

If you have any symptoms, do not hesitate to contact your physician who will prescribe a PCR test.
For more information:
Asthma attacks are usually not accompanied by fever, although it occurs in 80 per cent of cases of COVID-19.

Can I visit my relatives in the hospital?
Once seated, guests may remove their masks, which they must put back on in order to move around or leave the establishment.
Under the law on the mandatory reporting of infectious diseases, laboratories are required to report test results for certain infectious diseases within specified time limits.
If you want to visit a relative who has been admitted to a hospital for an other reason than a COVID-19 infection, please be advised that a maximum of 2 visits per day are allowed, each for a maximum of one hour.
I am a cross-border worker, can I get tested in Luxembourg?
Quarantine applies to people who have had high-risk contact with a person with a confirmed infection (face-to-face contact for more than 15 minutes, unprotected physical contact, etc.).
This is why you must continue to limit your outings and contacts , respect barrier gestures and wear a mask whenever it is not possible to keep a distance of two metres from people who do not live with you under the same roof.
You can organise or participate in public events with more than ten people indoors or outdoors (cultural or sports events, congresses, etc.), provided that the following two rules apply:
Disposable masks distributed to residents and cross-border workers cannot be washed and have to be disposed of in a waste bin after having worn them for a maximum of 8 hours.
Wearing a mask is compulsory for those supervising the event and for participants when they are not seated.
Therefore, a visor alone cannot provide efficient protection against coronavirus.
To better understand how teleconsultation works, do not hesitate to view these explanatory videos :
The person who tested positive is asked to provide the Health Inspectorate with the contact details of all close contacts they have had in the days prior to the test and/or before the onset of symptoms.
Nevertheless, delays longer than one day may occur and laboratories may send some PCR test results with a delay of several days.
In this letter, you will find information regarding the procedure, the link to the website www.covidtesting.lu and the password which will enable you to make an appointment online.
The medical centres in Luxembourg, Esch-Alzette and Ettelbruck will only receive patients who do not show symptoms of COVID-19.
Caution: According to the data currently available, a positive serological test result does not indicate that the person is immune or that he or she can no longer be contagious.
They are not useful for the diagnosis of the acute infection.
Those conditions are:
A person with chronic asthma is usually very familiar with the symptoms of his disease and can easily differentiate these symptoms from those of a COVID-19 infection.
Individuals are considered vulnerable if they are over 65 years of age or if they are already suffering from one of the conditions mentioned hereafter.
As a general rule, if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection or if you are in doubt about a possible COVID-19 contamination, you can contact your doctor.
Ambulatory activities are subject to strict rules (staggering of patients to avoid crowded waiting rooms, strict compliance with time schedules, etc.).
During weekends, you can go to the Centre hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL) for urgent dental needs.
Restaurants, cafes, bars, other drinking establishments and venues for sports or cultural events such as theatres, cultural centres, concert halls, cinemas and places of worship are open to the public.
Public transport drivers do not need to wear the mask when the distance between them and users is at least two metres or when they are separated by a panel.
As a general rule, a contact lasting a quarter of an hour or more, without having maintained the distance of 2 metres and without wearing a mask at the time of this contact, is considered a close and direct contact requiring quarantine.
How do I know if I have COVID-19 or hay fever?
Based on the information obtained it is decided whether and when a COVID-19 test should be carried out.
Respiratory troubles caused by COVID-19 are progressive and permanent over the day and are accompanied by dry coughing.
Cultural, sports and leisure activities cannot accommodate the public if the conditions of wearing a mask and/or distancing are not respected.
At this time, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can infect others with the new coronavirus.
Failure to comply with consumption at the table is an offence punishable by a fine.
If you do intend to invite people, remember to respect the protective measures to limit the risk of contamination by a person who may be asymptomatic or who shows few symptoms of the disease.
23 People tested positive for Covid-19 (on residents)
The purpose of self-monitoring is to detect symptoms of infection as soon as they appear.
To facilitate the tracing of potentially contaminated people, remember to write down and update the list of people you have met recently (family members, friends, neighbours, colleagues, etc.).
For wearing a mask is merely a complementary means to barrier gestures which, although reducing the dissemination of droplets carrying the virus, can also present an additional risk of infection when not handled properly.
Family visits, access by health professionals and professionals providing personal care as well as residents' outings from residential facilities for the elderly are no longer subject to restrictions, provided that the "Temporary health recommendations of the Health Directorate for Individuals in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis " (Recommandations sanitaires temporaires de la Direction de la santé à l'attention des personnes physiques dans le cadre de la crise sanitaire liée au Covid-19) are respected.

Serological tests can help answer the question "Did I have a COVID-19-infection?
This is because gloves do not limit surface-to-surface transmission of the virus.
If you have hired staff to serve your guests, they must wear the mask at all times.
Thus, if you touch coronavirus-contaminated surfaces or objects with your gloves on, the virus will contaminate your gloves and then contaminate surfaces and personal items (keys, phone, bag or wallet, etc.) when handling them.
Yes, both the diagnostic PCR test and the serological test are voluntary.
What should I do if I have been in contact with someone who has tested positive?
It is compulsory to cover your nose and mouth with a mask, scarf or bandana on public transport and for activities that are open to the public (shops, counters, recycling centres, fairs and exhibitions, markets).
Formal and non-formal educational activities are exempted from the double condition of seating and the wearing of masks, as well as religious, cultural and sports actors during the exercise of their activities.
The requirement of assigned seating is not applicable for demonstrations (exercise of the right to demonstrate) or for fairs, exhibitions or funeral ceremonies.
The wearing of a mask or any other device that covers a person's nose and mouth is compulsory at all times for exhibitors and for visitors when an interpersonal distance of two metres cannot be respected.
Overall, there are many disadvantages to wearing gloves:
Wearing a mask is also compulsory for gatherings of more than 20 people during which the distance of two meters cannot be respected.
Since antibody production is not detectable in symptomatic patients until the second week after the onset of symptoms, serological tests are not recommended for the early diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection in the first week after the onset of symptoms.
If you need to exert an economic activity, contact your physician by teleconsultation .
After the test you will be informed about the result by text message.
Coping with stress
Does the new coronavirus pose a threat to pregnant women or fetuses?
In addition, you shouldn't underestimate the risk of transferring the virus to your hands when taking off your gloves.
The Health Inspectorate officers then inquire about the state of health of the contact and inform him/her about the necessary measures and precautions, including protective measures.
Single-use gloves should only be worn by healthcare professionals when providing care that requires physical, skin-to-skin contact with people who are potentially infected (with coronavirus or other infectious agents).
Severe forms of COVID-19 in children remain uncommon.
Symptoms can be similar to those caused by a COVID-19 infection, especially for people with allergies who experience asthma and respiratory disorders.
The incubation period, the time between contamination and the appearance of the first symptoms of COVID-19 infection, is maximum 14 days.
In order to get more information about the correct use of masks, please read these recommendations .
If the space between the tables side by side does not allow a distance of at least 1.5 metres, they must be separated by a device such as a screen or panel.

What treatment exists for COVID-19 infection?
Information on the procedures and eligibility conditions can be consulted via www.covid19.lu .
The treatment is therefore mainly symptomatic, i.e. it is similar to the treatment for a cough, respiratory problems or high temperature.
Non-compliance with the wearing of a mask and/or seating distance is an offence punishable by a fine.
This will help determine whether or not you are afflicted with COVID-19.
COVID-19 can be contracted by inhaling aerosols or droplets from a sick person who has just coughed or sneezed.
Visits for patients who have been admitted due to a (suspected or confirmed) COVID-19 infection remain suspended, except under exceptional circumstances which need to be supported by medical advice, i.e. end of life situations or significant psychological distress, .
As a result of this catching-up on tests, retrospective corrections are made to the statistics presented on the www.covid19.lu website.
As of 11 March, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has qualified the COVID-19 as a global pandemic.

Breaking the infection chain
The tests per contingent are carried out in 3 stages:
"We are pleased that the government has confidence in Research Luxembourg to support it at this historic stage.
The testing strategy consists of expanding the capacity to 20,000 tests per day.
This allows monitoring of whether and how the virus is spreading within the contingent.
"The high number of tests carried out will help to assess the extent of the spread of the virus and to detect for the first time asymptomatic cases, which are currently estimated to account for up to 80% of cases.
8,500 tests for students and teachers this week, 20,000 tests per day in a later phase
In addition, the experience gained now will in the long term also serve to be better prepared as a country in the event of another pandemic.
Their contacts are traced, tested and quarantined to break the chain of infection.
The tests are voluntary: everyone can get tested, no one has to.
In the next few days and weeks, up to 17 test stations will be set up in the country, where the inhabitants of Luxembourg, but also cross-border commuters, can be tested.
Projections to better guide the deconfinement strategy
Based on a list of priorities elaborated by ministries and other partners, a number of work packages have been defined, which the COVID-19 Task Force will work on in the coming weeks and months.
"As the protection is greater the more people are tested, we want to encourage all residents of the country to participate in this unique public health measure," she added.
"The projections we make on the basis of the test results help policymakers to make decisions on the exit strategy and to adapt measures to the situation at any time.
This makes us the first country in the world to have a complete overview of the number of infected citizens," said Minister of Higher Education and Research, Claude Meisch.
For this reason, Research Luxembourg (LIH, LISER, LIST, LNS, Luxinnovation, University of Luxembourg and FNR, under the coordination of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research) has set up the COVID-19 Task Force in order to better implement relevant initiatives.
This project, which primarily serves a public health objective, will also enable research to gain a better understanding of the virus in the medium term - which is important in order to learn how we can better live with the virus in the future.
The testing starts already this week: about 6,000 high school graduates and 2,500 teachers have the opportunity to get tested before they go back to school from May 4th, 2020.
The core elements of the large-scale testing strategy
A deconfinement strategy framed by health and research measures
The objective is to be able to test the entire population, progressively and in contingents, in some cases several times.
Efficient measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic require close cooperation between research, hospitals and the Government in Luxembourg.
What is the COVID-19 Task Force?
Press release by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Higher Education and Research and Research Luxembourg
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, researchers, statisticians and doctors work together on a daily basis to produce projections for Luxembourg that are as accurate as possible, based on which the decision-makers can then decide on the measures to be taken.
This enables us to take the difficult path out of the COVID-19 crisis towards normality in the most controlled way possible.
On the one hand, this minimises risks and on the other hand, provides a solid basis for the government to make decisions," Ulf Nehrbass concludes.
This means that we can detect many more infected people than before, put them in isolation and track their contacts, thus breaking the infection chain", says Minister of Health, Paulette Lenert.
The overall objective is to avoid a second wave of infected people in the context of exit measures and thus the introduction of a new lockdown.
The results of these tests give an indication of when the contingent can be freed from restrictions and when it should be tested on a large scale
The Research Luxembourg large-scale testing strategy is based on large-scale virus testing, in which the population is not considered as a whole, but divided into different contingents.
Important indicators include, for example, the ability to trace contacts and the capacity of the health system", says Prof. Rudi Balling, Director of the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine at the University of Luxembourg.
The large-scale testing strategy developed by the COVID-19 Task Force is based on the following 5 elements:
Positive tested people must enter isolation.
As part of its exit strategy, the Luxembourg government can count on the support of Luxembourg research, namely the Research Luxembourg COVID-19 Task Force.
This will ensure that Luxembourg can better and in an informed manner accompany the lifting of restrictions from the lockdown.
"Due to the size of Luxembourg and its limited number of residents, we have a great opportunity: we can test the entire population for the novel coronavirus within a short period of time.
Stage 1: a representative population of a contingent is tested.
Stage 3: A representative group is selected shortly after the exit measures in order to be tested a second time.
Stage 2: All persons in the contingent are invited to be tested on a voluntary basis.
By shortening the lockdown period, psychological, economic and social problems will be kept to a minimum.
Efficient and fast tracing of positive tested people and subsequent quarantine-measures
In close cooperation with the Ministry of Higher Education and Research and the Ministry of Health, the COVID-19 Task Force has developed a "Large Scale Testing Strategy" based on a voluntary diagnostic test accessible to the population, including cross-border commuters of the Greater Region.
The COVID-19 Task Force is well organised for this.
The aim is to effectively accompany the spread of the virus and to keep it under control at all times," says Ulf Nehrbass, spokesman of the COVID-19 Task Force and CEO of the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH).
Isolation of positive tested people
To this end, the COVID-19 Task Force is continuously working on updates on the development of the pandemic in Luxembourg and submits concepts and recommendations from a scientific perspective so that they can be incorporated into the political decision-making process.
High testing capacity: test each contingent, with the aim of gradually and on a voluntary basis testing the largest possible part of the population and then exempting those who test negative from restrictive measures
Testing and segmentation of the population into contingents
Segmentation of the population into contingents
For people tested negative, the restrictions of the lockdown are lifted.
Consistent monitoring of key parameters - to monitor the evolution of the COVID 19 pandemic in Luxembourg at all times and to provide a basis for decisions on the scope of testing and the introduction of relaxation or restriction measures
In cooperation with the government, the COVID-19 Task Force sees its role in providing scientific input to enable the government to work on a fact-based EXIT strategy.

The same applies at this stage for entry into Austria.
Among the countries of the European Union, such an obligation currently exists for travel to Germany and the Portuguese islands of Madeira and Azores.
For trips scheduled from 3 August, a new system will be put in place at the beginning of next week.
Covidtest for residents who must travel abroad by 2 August 2020
Travelers are also responsible for obtaining information from the competent local authorities (see websites of the embassies of the countries concerned) on the conditions in place at the time of travel.
It will suffice to have the supporting documents requested by the local authorities.
This service, as it was recently set up, will remain applicable for trips that will be made until 2 August 2020 to a country explicitly requiring a negative COVID-19 test.
In order to make it easier for Luxembourg residents who have to travel to one of these countries to obtain a COVID-19 test before their departure, the Luxembourg government, in an effort to respond quickly to a situation that was unpredictable at the time, has set up since 17 July 2020 a system that allows you to register to carry out the said test free of charge as part of the large-scale testing ( www.covid19.lu ).
Following the upsurge of the COVID-19 virus in recent weeks, some countries are obliging people from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to present a negative COVID-19 test upon entry.
A negative test is also necessary for persons coming from Luxembourg transiting through Slovakia to another country.
In order to transit through Germany or Switzerland, a negative COVID-19 test is not required.
On the other hand, a negative COVID-19 test does not remove the obligation to self-isolate and to perform a PCR test on site during a stay in Slovakia itself.
A negative COVID-19 test carried out within 48 hours also allows people from Luxembourg to transit through Lithuania to another country while a stay in Lithuania is prohibited for travelers from Luxembourg.
Travel to Italy and Greece also does not require negative COVID-19 tests for entry into the country.
Likewise, a negative COVID-19 test is not required for Luxembourg residents who travel to Portugal via France and Spain.
Similarly, there is no COVID-19 test requirement for stays in France and Spain itself.
​ Luxembourg residents are asked to submit their request for a COVID-19 diagnostic test.

Thus, the following activities are again authorized:
WHAT ARE THE GOOD REFLEXES TO ADOPT?
Public swimming pools remain closed.
Remember to especially protect vulnerable people.
Re-opening of shops (with exceptions).
WHAT IS PHASE 2 OF DECONFINEMENT?
Re-opening of the National Archives, public libraries, museums, exhibition centers.
This helps you limit the spread of the virus in the population.
This is still the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.
The mask only protects you to a limited extent against infection, but your mask protects those around you.
The success of the deconfinement strategy is based on 3 key principles: personal responsibility, solidarity with others and discipline.
Show solidarity!
Outdoor sports activities without physical contact, of a non-competitive nature and without an audience.
Don‘t forget the traditional barrier gestures: wash your hands, keep an interpersonal distance of 2m, etc.
Following the first phase, essentially aimed at reactivating the construction sector, phase 2 of the deconfinement proposes new measures for a gradual exit from the state of confinement, which is subject to strict compliance with sanitary measures and barrier gestures as of May 11th.
Personal responsibility and solidarity with your fellow citizens are additional
Even if the confinement (#BleiftDoheem) is no longer a legal obligation, it is nevertheless recommended.
Be disciplined!
Even if the confinement (#bleiftdoheem) is no longer a legal obligation, it is nevertheless recommended to limit your interpersonal contacts and your movements to the necessary.
Visits or meetings of a private nature organized at home for a maximum number of six people, in addition to the people already living in the same household under the strict respect of sanitary measures (interpersonal distance of 2m / wear of masks).
Outdoor gatherings in a public place for a maximum number of twenty people under the strict respect of sanitary measures (interpersonal distance of 2m / wear of masks).

Good to know
The test becomes a gesture of solidarity, and allows to protect one another: "your test, our summer!"
In case of questions regarding the large-scale testing for COVID-19, it is possible to call the dedicated Helpline at the number (+352) 28 55 83-1, from Monday to Friday between 8.00 and 18.00.
A person can get infected later.
The applicant must indicate, in particular:
the date and time of their appointment among the proposed time slots.
What happens if the test is negative and the person is infected a few days later?
This document must be presented in paper or electronic format at the appointment.
Persons who are the most exposed to the virus and who are in contact with numerous persons will be tested regularly.
Tutorial : how to book an appointment ?
The underlying strategy is as follows: instead of testing the entire population at the same time, the objective is to ensure that every week someone in one's environment is tested; this reinforces everyone's protection.
The procedure can be completed without using a LuxTrust authentication method.
Why is each person invited to be tested individually when other family members, friends or co-workers are not tested yet?
It is not possible to cancel or change the appointment directly on the website.
The applicant can make an appointment online using the form provided for this purpose on MyGuichet.lu .
Indeed, the test groups create, so to speak, a safety net that leaves virtually no room for the virus, and this for many weeks.
If the result is positive, the person tested will also be contacted by the services of the Health Directorate which will provide support.
The person tested is informed of the result by text message (SMS) within two working days.
The COVID-19 test upon invitation by the Luxembourg government is free of charge.
But thanks to the system of testing representative groups spread over time, the tests are not just a snapshot of the situation.
The large-scale testing strategy divides people into representative groups based on their work sector and their residential area.
The fact that there is always one person from a particular group being tested helps identify at any moment chains of infections to which that person may belong.
It is important that everyone, including people with a negative result, continues to observe the usual barrier gestures .
Important: A majority of those infected show little or no symptoms or are already contagious before showing symptoms.
This is the best way to break the chains of infection and to efficiently trace the contacts of the people infected (contact tracing).
Invitation to make an appointment
By getting tested and respecting the recommendations of the Health Directorate (Direction de la Santé), the person helps reducing the total number of infected people to a minimum.
A negative PCR test does not mean that one is immune.
The COVID-19 tests (PCR) are for:
Now that PCR tests are also available for people without symptoms, more infected people can be identified and the necessary measures to prevent other people from being infected can be taken as soon as possible.
Appointments can only be made if the invitation letter with the code has been received.
Cancelling and rescheduling an appointment
Why should one get tested, even without showing any symptoms?
Anyone who has already made an appointment can cancel it and make a new one using the link provided in the appointment confirmation email.
The applicant receives an appointment confirmation by email after transmitting the request.
Therefore, everyone, including those who test negative, should continue to observe the usual protective gestures.
In the context of the lifting of the confinement, the Luxembourg government invites residents and cross-border workers to participate voluntarily in the free of charge large-scale COVID-19 testing.
It allows to protect one's family, friends, colleagues and, last but not least, risk groups.
Each week, a new representative group will receive the invitation letter for an appointment.
Invitations to participate in the large-scale testing are mailed by post each week to residents and cross-border workers divided into representative groups.
This means that within one's family, one's neighbourhood or among one's colleagues, the invitations are deliberately delayed by several weeks.
Even if all new infections cannot be prevented, a second wave can be prevented collectively.
Participate in large-scale testing for COVID-19
Who is concerned
Hence, it may be that one carries the virus (and is therefore contagious) without knowing it.
Please note: the appointment booking must be validated by clicking on "Send".
The COVID-19 test (PCR throat swab) indicates whether the person being tested is contagious.
Residents and cross-border workers will be given the opportunity to undergo voluntary testing over a period of several weeks.
COVID-19 Large-scale testing: Get yourself tested - More information
Over a period of several weeks, residents and cross-border workers will have the opportunity to be tested on a voluntary basis.

Sources of contamination:
In view of the new statistical data, Minister of Health Paulette Lenert also welcomes the decision of the German federal government to no longer consider the Grand Duchy as a risk area.
23 cases came from 7 identified active infection clusters (businesses, housing communities, leisure activities, health and care sector).
In this context, the Ministry of Health reiterates its appeal to travellers to respect protective measures, adopt responsible behaviour during their holidays and to be tested on their return if they had any high risk contacts.
Indeed, it can be observed that the proportion of cases returning from holidays is increasing significantly, accounting for 25% of all positive cases.
Of the 249 positive cases for the week in question, 63 cases were related to travels abroad.
In addition, 52 cases (21%) probably were transmitted within families and 12 cases (5%) were related to family or friends' parties.
Distribution of quarantines by age group:
During this period, 249 new infections (-30%), as well as 1,779 contacts (-27%) were recorded.
The effective reproductive rate (R) increased slightly from 0.73 to 0,78 while the positivity rate on the tests performed increased from 0.70% to 0.66% (average for the week).
For the week of 10 to 16 August, 1,073 people were in quarantine (-20% compared to the previous week) and 763 in isolation (-31% compared to the previous week).
During the week in question, there were 2 new deaths related to COVID-19.
​ For the second week in a row the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 has been below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants.
As of 16 August, the number of active infections was 606 (compared to 930 as of 09/08), while the number of people healed increased from 6,168 to 6,739.
For the week of 10 to 16 August, the average age of those diagnosed as COVID-19 positive is 35 years, and thus remains stable compared to previous weeks.

In the context of the pandemic of the Coronavirus COVID-19, the Luxembourg Government informs citizens as well as businesses receiving customers from the public, that the respect of certain specific principles concerning the circulation of customers is necessary, in order to limit the spread of the virus in the population.
It is therefore recommended to keep an interpersonal distance of 2 metres.
Below you will find the essential protective measures: https://gd.lu/5G9t9Q
Press release by the General Directorate for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
It is also advisable to use one shopping trolley per person (1 trolley = 1 person).
Social distancing also applies to the area in front of the shops entrance.
It is also advisable to regulate the entry of customers and thus limit the number of people who can access the shops at the same time.
It is thus recommended to respect the social distancing within the shops, i.e. to ensure that an interpersonal distance of 2 metres between each person, present in the respective shop, is respected.
Customers are also advised to go shopping on their own, without taking other people with them, and to keep shopping to a minimum.

All of our employees are available to answer your calls and enquiries.
The procedures have been adapted to the current situation in order to guarantee quality service and to process incoming requests.
The AEC urges the families to limit the people in the room to the bare minimum, namely the applicant and their caregiver.
Please consult the official website www.covid19.lu for all information on the COVID-19 coronavirus, as well as on its symptoms, its transmission and how to protect yourself and those close to you.
We work in close collaboration with the « Service Moyen Accessoire (SMA) » which guarantees the delivery of urgent assistive technology that is essential for a return home, namely: bed with motorized adjustment, alternating mattress, toilet chair with wheels, active and passive lifter for persons, positioning wheelchair.
The wearing of a mask or any other device making it possible to effectively cover the nose and mouth is mandatory throughout the assessment if the distance of 2 meters cannot be guaranteed.
Dependent persons with specific questions relating to their "long-term care insurance" file can continue to contact the AEC.
In the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and following the instructions and measures announced by the Government, the State Office for Assessment and Monitoring (AEC) of the long-term care insurance has taken a certain number of measures in relation to its target audience in order to ensure the best health for the elderly and those in need of protection.

It is also a strategic tool for researchers to build, improve and assess the models on which their recommendations to these decision-makers are based.
The Cross-Functional Dashboard is a step forward in the direction of providing a more comprehensive overview of a complex situation to decision-makers.
This is part of the dashboard that can be connected to remote sensors located in buildings around the country, and send data back to the dashboard in real time.
"Composed of data from a multitude of specific areas, the Cross-Functional Dashboard provides an overview with which policy makers can rely on to manage the health crisis and therefore limit its economic and social consequences.
Press release by the ministry of the Economy / ministry of Higher Education and Research /Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology
Other perspectives of the dashboard were shown such as "Digital Twin."
"This dashboard is one of the examples of the excellent collaboration between public research players, a collaboration that I can only encourage and which has enabled public research to effectively support the Government within the framework of the management of this health crisis," said Claude Meisch, Minister for Higher Education and Research.
The Ministers were joined on Monday by representatives from several organisations that supply and share data feeding into the dashboard; the University of Luxembourg's Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER) and Luxinnovation.
This tool therefore testifies to the existing skills within the Luxembourg research community that allow us to rigorously combat the COVID-19 pandemic", said Minister of the Economy Franz Fayot following the visit.
Ministers Franz Fayot and Claude Meisch during the demonstration of the Cross-functional Dashboard
LISER's social-economic model was demonstrated on the VisWall as well as data for infection, recovery and hospital occupation relating to COVID-19 infections.
After an initial welcome by the CEO of LIST Thomas Kallstenius, the guests were shown presentations demonstrating what the collaboration between the organisations has managed to achieve up to the present time, in Luxembourg's fight against COVID-19.
Our joint ambition is to develop the integrated dashboard, and the data analytics engine behind it, to support the decision makers and policy makers during the COVID-19 pandemic but also to position Luxembourg as blueprint for a digital, sustainable and resilient economy in a post-COVID-19 crisis world".
The Minister of the Economy Franz Fayot and the Minister for Higher Education and Research Claude Meisch visited Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) on Monday.
In these difficult times, resilience is key and a systemic crisis like COVID-19 has shown that being resilient is a multi-faceted challenge.
Thomas Kallstenius concluded, "It's indeed important to emphasise the collaborative spirit of this effort by all the research and innovation actors in Luxembourg.
There are still many further steps to take to include for instance more artificial intelligence in the system but the Cross-Functional Dashboard shows that by joining their forces Luxembourg institutions have the capacity to be at the forefront to further increase the resilience of the country.
Their motive was an inspection and demonstration of the "Cross-Functional Dashboard", in relation to the country's COVID-19 data, which runs on the Institute's Visual Wall (VisWall), a mosaic of 24 high-resolution 46-inch touch screens spanning seven meters.
As an example of real time data processing, live motorway traffic camera footage from around Luxembourg was shown on the VisWall and it was demonstrated how, by manipulating a map, it was possible to view and interact with the videos.

In addition, these same persons may request, for taxes due after 29 February 2020, a payment extension of four months.
The deadline for submitting, revoking or modifying a request for individual taxation is postponed to the same date.
This measure allows to satisfy the liquidity needs of around 20,000 companies established in the Grand Duchy.
Due to the crisis resulting from the spread of Covid-19, the Government has decided to introduce several tax measures in favour of legal and natural persons.
With regard to indirect taxes, the Administration de l'enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA will reimburse this week all VAT credit balances below 10,000 euros.
More specifically, legal persons and natural persons carrying out an activity generating trade and business income, agriculture and forestry income, or income from independent professional services, who are experiencing liquidity problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic, can apply for a cancellation of the two first quarterly advance tax payments of the year 2020 (due in March and June 2020).
The main objective of these measures is to alleviate the financing and liquidity needs of corporations and self-employed persons strongly impacted by the current economic environment.
Fiscal measures to support companies and self-employed hit by the COVID-19 pandemic
With regard to direct taxes, the modalities of the advance tax payments and payment deadlines will be adapted for corporations and self-employed persons.
It should also be noted that the deadline for submitting tax returns has been extended to 30 June 2020.
Covered by this measure are (corporate) income and municipal business taxes.
The new submission date is applicable for both legal and natural persons.
On this deferral, no interest on late payment will be due and it covers (corporate) income, municipal business, and net wealth taxes.
To benefit from these two aforementioned measures, it is sufficient to send the two newly created forms to the competent tax office of the Administration des contributions directes.

New non-repayable allowance for the self-employed
The condition of not receiving a professional income exceeding the threshold of 2.5 times the social minimum wage is maintained.
The Minister for Small and Medium-sized Businesses stated that "we are prepared to take all necessary measures to support companies and self-employed persons in difficulty.
It will also benefit insurance brokers and agents who were excluded from the scope of the first aid.
In addition, the aid may be granted irrespective of the number of staff employed by the self-employed person.
This aid is in addition to the certified emergency fund which was created by Grand-Ducal Regulation of 8 April 2020 in favour of self-employed workers.
The Luxembourg government has decided to strengthen the support mechanism for the self-employed affected by the financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 6 May 2020, on the proposal of the Minister for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Lex Delles, the Government Council thus approved a draft Grand Ducal Regulation aimed at setting up new, single flat-rate, non-repayable financial aid in their favour.
This aid takes into account the income bracket of the self-employed person, thus ensuring targeted and equitable support".
The amount of the new aid varies depending on the income bracket of the person concerned, these amounts being set at 3.000, 3.500 and 4.000 euros.
The form for submitting requests will be available on Guichet.lu on Tuesday 12 May 2020.

The national innovation agency, together with the Ministry of the Economy, has also had the lead on the implementation of a specific action plan for start-ups.

The ministry also offers support to companies engaged in the production of products used in the fight against COVID-19 (vaccines, drugs and treatments, medical devices and hospital and medical equipment, protective clothing and equipment, diagnostic tools, disinfectants, data collection and processing tools, etc.).
The EPI-Covid19.lu platform was created in just a few days by Luxinnovation in cooperation with the wedo.lu team of the Fédération des Artisans.
Selected companies will receive financial support of up to €150,000 from the Ministry of the Economy for the development of innovative technological products and services intended to limit or even overcome the economic, health or societal effects of the coronavirus crisis.

COVID-19: Venues for the celebration of marriages and civil partnerships
Press release by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Justice
This emergency measure could serve as an opportunity to learn from the experience of the municipalities with a view to this modernisation.
That is why the Minister of Justice, Sam Tanson, and the Minister for Home Affairs, Taina Bofferding, have proposed to allow marriages and PACS not only at the town hall but also, temporarily, in other municipal buildings.
As a result of the distancing measures imposed by the government during the COVID-19 crisis state, the organisation of marriage ceremonies and civil partnerships declarations (PACS) in the town hall, with a maximum number of 20 people, poses a problem for a number of municipalities, given the insufficient size of the rooms available.
The Government in council of 4 May 2020 approved a derogation to article 75 of the Civil Code allowing the civil registrar to celebrate marriages in a municipal building other than the town hall.
The buildings in question are to be determined by the board of the mayor and aldermen.

50% of support from the Ministry of the Economy
Depending on the companies' size and complexity, the development work may last between 5 and 25 days.
An addition, all the feedback that we receive from the field will allow us to develop good practices that can be shared with all the stakeholders in the ecosystem.
The analysis will focus both on their internal functioning and on their interaction with customers and suppliers.
"The objective is to help companies make the most detailed diagnosis possible of their strategic positioning," says Sasha Baillie, CEO of Luxinnovation.
The feedback will also help in the economic development of each sector over time, by emphasising what will have worked well and what will have worked less well."
Interested companies can apply to the programme via the fit4resilience.lu platform, which is available on the Luxinnovation website.
I'm delighted with the initiative taken by Luxinnovation to help all companies reposition, or even reinvent, themselves, following the upheavals they have undergone in their respective environments," says Minister of the Economy Franz Fayot.
"This in-depth analysis will cover the companies' ecosystem and products as well as their supply and distribution channels in order to measure the impact of the crisis on these different dimensions.
Esch-sur-Alzette, 28 May 2020 - Luxinnovation, the national innovation agency, with the support of the Ministry of the Economy, is launching "Fit 4 Resilience".
The aim is to support companies in their analysis of how they have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in order to identify the paths to follow to reinvent themselves and relaunch their activities in a more resilient manner.
This programme helps companies to manage their way out of the crisis, as well as to develop a longer-term development strategy.
This bill provides for three types of investment aid for development and innovation (process and organisation) projects and projects aimed at improving energy efficiency or exceeding standards.
FIT 4 RESILIENCE: A NEW PROGRAMME HELPING COMPANIES TO RELAUNCH AND REINVENT THEMSELVES
"The Fit 4 Resilience programmes targets SMEs as well as manufacturing industry and large companies that have been structurally impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
The Ministry of the Economy will cover 50% of the consultancy costs for eligible companies.
With the support of consulting firms specialising in strategy, approved by Luxinnovation, Fit 4 Resilience will help companies prepare a repositioning plan and develop an action plan covering the short and medium-term perspective.
Luxinnovation contributes to the economic development of Luxembourg by fostering innovation, fuelling international growth and attracting foreign direct investment.
The Fit 4 Resilience programme is implemented with the support of the House of Entrepreneurship of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Skilled Trades, the Fédération des Artisans and FEDIL.
The Fit 4 Resilience programme follows the same general approach and broad outlines as Luxinnovation's "Fit 4" performance programmes that have already proved their worth in other areas.
Ideally, the future strategies will include a more digital, circular and regional perspective.
"The programme is part of the national economic recovery policy ‘Neistart Lëtzebuerg' aimed at rebounding as quickly as possible after the health and economic crisis that our businesses are going through," says the Minister.
On Wednesday 15 April, a consultation meeting was held between the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Association of Luxembourg Towns and Municipalities (Syndicat des villes et communes luxembourgeoises - SYVICOL) in order to organise the distribution of surgical masks to the entire population and to the services of municipalities and similar entities.
Press release by the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Family Affairs, Integration and the Greater Region
Any vulnerable person who may have recourse to another means of supply (family members, Scouts, etc.) is being asked to not use this website or phone number.
The new platform offers a home delivery service for more than 40 basic necessities such as rice, pasta, milk, fruit and vegetables.
New online sales platform for vulnerable people
The new platform is a key element in this process, as it allows those concerned to obtain supplies in complete safety.
This includes people over 65 years, as well as individuals with diabetes, a cardiovascular condition, a chronic illness of the respiratory tract, an immune system weakened by a condition or treatment, or cancer.
Minister for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Lex Delles stated in this context that "we all have to prove our solidarity, especially in these difficult times.
The main website letzshop.lu remains open to the public.
Minister for Family Affairs and Integration Corinne Cahen stressed that "we absolutely must protect vulnerable people.
In order to reach out to all of the vulnerable people, the platform corona.letzshop.lu is not only available online, but can also be contacted via telephone on 8002 92 92.
On 19 March 2020, Minister for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Lex Delles and Minister for Family Affairs and Integration Corinne Cahen launched the online sales platform corona.letzshop.lu , dedicated to vulnerable people.
In the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, this platform supports people who are not able to make their purchases themselves by taking advantage of the existing letzshop.lu infrastructure.
Thanks to the corona.letzshop.lu platform, vulnerable people have access to products of basic necessity, without exposing themselves to the potentially dangerous proximity of other people."
It should be noted in this context that the online sales platform corona.letzshop.lu is exclusively dedicated to sales to vulnerable people who have no other means of obtaining supplies.
I therefore call on citizens to use this platform only if they are considered vulnerable and have no other means of obtaining supplies."
Measures taken by the Government Council on 12 March 2020 in response to the Coronavirus
In particular:
Gradual reopening over one month
Barrier measures to be respected by all
"For us, public health is a priority", emphasized Claude Meisch.

The teacher will hold the same course two weeks in a row.
'I hope that soon the school can once again become this place of life, laughter, meeting and exchange that is so important for our children and young people', concluded Claude Meisch.
A timetable and a method have been identified, with two clear objectives: to provide all children and young people with the best possible prospects for the future and to protect the health of students and teaching and educational staff to the greatest extent possible.
The Ministry will distribute 2 such devices to each student and teacher;
At the same time, a series of barrier measures will have to be put in place and respected in the schools.
the provision of disinfectant;
One week of classes, one week of revising
closing the canteens to avoid contact between students from different groups;
the compression of school hours, particularly in basic school.
the respect for class groups so that pupils don't mix too much;
The government has analysed how to lift the suspension of school and educational activities step by step.
social distancing, which will be facilitated in schools and school transport by the system of alternating courses;
Following on from the measures announced on 2 April , the challenge remains to prepare effectively for the start of the new school year on 15 September by focusing on the learning of essential content.
the wearing of a protective device to cover the nose and mouth, which will be allowed in class and compulsory in transport.
Specifically, each class will be divided into two groups, both in elementary and secondary education and in vocational training.
Special recommendations will be developed for crèches and cycle 1 of fundamental education, where it is more difficult for young children to comply with barrier gestures.
Each group will have a week of classes and learning at school or high school, followed by a week of revision at home or in a childcare facility.
For the most vulnerable pupils, the skills centres, the psycho-socio-educational teams and the services of the National Office for Children will be able to continue their care from 20 April.
Trainees will be able to return to their apprenticeship positions in companies in sectors that have been deconfined.
As far as the timetable is concerned, it was decided to reopen classes first to high school students who, due to their maturity, are better able to respect the barrier gestures and measures to continue to slow down the spread of the virus.
A gradual resumption of courses and classes organised in alternating sessions starting on 4 May 2020
On 16 April 2020, the Minister of Education, Children and Youth, Claude Meisch, explained the phased resumption of activities in schools and childcare facilities.
Distancing rules will also be applied to secondary school leaving examinations and final integrated vocational training projects.
In terms of method, the government has opted for a return to the classroom on a rotating basis.
From 25 May, the children will once again be able to attend elementary education and the childcare facilities and parental assistants will be able to resume their work.
From 4 May, students in the senior classes will resume courses, followed on 11 May by all other classes in secondary education and vocational training, as well as the Advanced Technician's Certificate (Brevet de technicien supérieur - BTS).

Recommendations to companies
Finally, it was specified that the repayment of the aid must not begin until 12 months at the earliest after the first payment of the reimbursable advance.
Today, the Government approved amendments which extend the scope of the draft law, presented last week by the Minister for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Minister for Tourism, Lex Delles and the Minister of the Economy, Franz Fayot, on the establishment of an aid scheme to large companies and liberal professions.
The text assimilates to personnel costs, income from the exercise of a professional activity carried out as a self-employed person on condition that the person is affiliated as such with the provisions of the Social security code, these costs being capped at an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the minimum social wage.
In addition, the maximum amount of aid, which is a repayable advance in favour of companies in temporary financial difficulty, has been raised from 200,000 to 500,000 euros per single company (group).
The Luxembourg Government has decided to strengthen support for companies affected by the financial consequences associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
In the interest of administrative simplification, the method calculating eligible costs has also been revised.
The amended text states as eligible costs the firm's staff costs and rental charges, the latter being capped at EUR 10,000 per month per single firm.
This draft law complements existing aid schemes such as short-time work.

For more information
The Prime Minister represents the government on national, European and international level.
Other services presently depend on the Ministry of State.
The Central legislation service is also responsible for the publication of the Official Journal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
Article 6 of the amended Grand-Ducal royal decree of the 9 July 1857 regarding the organisation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg's government states : "the Minister of State shall supervise the general course of affairs and shall ensure the uphold of the unity of principles which is to be applied in the various parts of the state ".
The Prime Minister thus presides the meetings of the Government Council and ensures the coordination of the general policy between the ministerial departments.
The services of the Ministry of State are also responsible for the organisation of legislative elections and European elections as well as referendums at the national level.
The General Secretariat of the Government Council is assisting the Prime minister in carrying out this task.
The role of the Prime Minister is that of an inter-ministerial coordinator.
As the coordinator of the government's actions and bearing the responsibility of its unity, the position of the Prime Minister in the government unveils as singular regarding its preponderance and its essential action to guarantee the cohesion of the government and the effective implementation of the government's actions.
The Communications and Media Service manages the responsibilities of the Minister for Communications and Media, namely the media, space, electronic communications and postal services, as well as data protection.
Certain policy areas fall naturally within the remit of the Ministry of State, and in particular, those related to the organisation of the State and the constitutional prerogatives of the government.
Therefore, the Ministry of State is tasked with the institutional relations with the Grand Ducal Court, the Chamber of Deputies and the Council of State.
The Consultative Commission on Human Rights, the "oeuvre nationale de Secours Grande-Duchesse Charlotte" and the relations with the mediator are also part of the Prime Minister's portfolio.
The Information and Press Service of the Luxembourg government is part of the Ministry of State and informs the media, the general public and interested circles about the activities carried out by the government.
State honours and awards as well as public ceremonies also fall within the remit of the Ministry of State.
The Economic and Social Council and the Commission of rationalisation and economies (CER) also fall within the remit of the Prime Minister's duties, as are the relations with the Central Bank of Luxembourg.
Operating under the umbrella of the Ministry of State, the Central legislation service coordinates all institutional relations between the government and the Chamber of Deputies as well as the Council of State.
With regard to relations of the government and the Chamber of Deputies in particular, the Minister in charge of the relations with the Parliament assists the Prime Minister in carrying out that task.
The competences of the Minister for Religious Affairs regroup the relations between the State and the religious communities and are administered by the services of the Ministry of State.
The National Committee for remembrance carries out missions linked to that duty.
In this regard, the duties of the Ministry of State also include matters related to state security, such as the Office of the High Commissioner for National Protection, the State Intelligence Service.

Reaching the most fragile students
Two weeks of "holiday at home"
The others caught up quickly.
Beyond a simple means of communication, new technologies are also tools for better learning with modern pedagogical content.
"These skills will not be lost when we return to our classes", the Minister said.
During the Easter holidays, there is no school programme.
"We have managed to work and adapt together, to combine our efforts in the interests of the children", said a delighted Claude Meisch.
Classes that were already using these media on a regular basis had head start in this area.
It appears that almost 9 out of 10 parents say they are comfortable with the means implemented by teachers and the Ministry.
New technologies in the service of distance learning
Inspiration and advice can be found at www.schouldoheem.lu , www.kannerdoheem.lu and on the National Youth Service (Service national de la jeunesse - SNJ) website at www.snj.lu .
These two weeks of "holidays at home" will allow families and teachers to relax, develop virtual social contacts and discover new activities.
The Minister also clarified that even if schools are closed, students remain subject to compulsory education.
This is why collaboration and communication among teachers, with students and with parents is essential.
On 2 April 2020, the Minister of Education, Children and Youth, Claude Meisch, announced the ministry's ambitions within the context of the suspension of school and educational activities which has just been extended by the Government until 3 May 2020 inclusive.
The Minister began by commending the enormous commitment and flexibility shown by teachers, parents and students.
The suspension of courses since 16 March has triggered a real dynamic in efforts to digitise learning.
A series of measures have been decided upon so that each student can complete his school year in good and due form and make progress in his school curriculum.
A particular concern is not to forget the most vulnerable, especially those students who could not be reached during the first three weeks of suspension of classes, whether for lack of computer equipment, family supervision or the ability to follow a learning process on their own.
New measures are planned to reach these students through support teams for students with special needs in basic education and through school psycho-social and support services (Services psycho-sociaux et d'accompagnement scolaires - SEPAS) and socio-educational services (Services socio-éducatifs - SSE) in secondary education.
A survey on distance learning (in French) gathered some 17,000 responses from parents and teachers.
The coronavirus crisis confronted the school, almost overnight, with the challenge of providing all students with distance education to ensure continuity of learning.
Not participating in distance learning is like skipping classes.
Suspension of classes extended until 3 May 2020 efforts to ensure the school education of all students
The details of the measures in the context of the extension of the suspension of activities until 3 May inclusive can be found in the attached press dossier(in French).

As of 1 April 2020, the CCSS is going to put the following temporary measures into place:
While it is clear that all social security contributions remain due, the employer can nevertheless better organise his cash flow, in combination with other economic measures introduced as part of the COVID-19 crisis.
Faced with the impact of COVID-19 on companies and the self-employed in Luxembourg, the Joint Social Security Centre (CCSS) and the Minister for Social Security, Romain Schneider, have taken a series of measures to support companies and the self-employed by offering them greater flexibility in their management of the payment of social security contributions.
The aforementioned measures do not only apply to future calls for contributions, but also to the current balances of social security contributions, notwithstanding any mention (interest, fines, etc.) on the CCSS statement of account dated 14 March 2020.
Measures at the level of social security contributions to be implemented in the context of the COVID-19 crisis by the Joint Social Security Centre
They will enable employers who find themselves in a financially precarious situation because of the COVID-19 crisis to better manage the payment of their social security contributions in the coming weeks, without having to fear administrative sanctions.
The purpose of this measure is to advance a substantial part of the reimbursement of salaries that employers must continue to pay to the parents concerned and which would normally only be made in May 2020 through the Employers' Mutual Insurance Scheme (Mutualité des Employeurs).
Suspension of fines to be pronounced against employers who are late in making declarations to the CCSS.
In addition to these measures, the CCSS will pay an advance on the financial compensation for extraordinary leave for family reasons granted to the parents of children affected by the temporary closure of basic and secondary education, vocational training and childcare facilities, etc.

The CCSS will contact employers potentially affected by such extraordinary leaves for family reasons in order to provide them with the information necessary to request such an advance on the reimbursement of the Employers' Mutual Insurance Fund.

Therefore, I call upon all to restore Schengen without delay.
This achievement is now being put to the test.
Step by step, the audacious dream of free movement was coming true!
Jean Asselborn, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Minister of Immigration and Asylum
In the meantime, the Schengen acquis has been incorporated into Union law through the Amsterdam Treaty and the Schengen area now covers 26 states among which Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland which are not members of the European Union.
Declaration by Jean Asselborn on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the Schengen Agreements
We need solidarity more than ever, and the rules of the Schengen area provide the framework for cooperation which will enable us to face this unprecedented challenge together.
Luxembourg calls out for this edifice, which is both the symbol of our Union and freedoms and which has become essential to our solidarity and prosperity, to be preserved.
The reintroduction of border controls at our common borders can only be occasional and temporary and must be done in accordance with the Treaties.
Implementing the rules of the Schengen area means removing border controls within the area and therefore strengthening the controls on its "outside" borders.
In these difficult times, Luxembourg is doing its utmost to facilitate the movement of cross-border workers and to ensure the continued transport of essential goods.
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, borders have been closed, causing enormous backlogs, blocking people who wish to go home, impeding workers' commute - many of whom are on the frontline in the fight against the virus - and furthermore complicating the delivery of essential goods, most notably medical supplies and food.
Today, the lives of many of our fellow citizens depend on the unhindered transit of workers, citizens being repatriated, essential medical supplies and goods.
Twenty-five years ago, on March 26th 1995, the provisions implementing the Schengen Agreements, which had been signed 10 years before, entered into force.

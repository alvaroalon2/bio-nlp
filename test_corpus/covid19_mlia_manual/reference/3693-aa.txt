Need for copyright reforms
Asia-Pacific region calls for international action on copyright
Participants referred to the Sustainable Development Goal 4 as a global commitment that requires resources, commitment, and political will.
Education International (EI) participated together with its affiliates, STU, MOVE, and PGRI.
Delegates voiced the need for an international instrument not only to address cross-border related challenges, but also to support governments to reform their national legislation.
Finally, three out of the four working groups led by governments in the region concluded that an international legal instrument will be essential to address the copyright-related challenges of modern education.
As confirmed by the WIPO secretariat, the recommendations of each regional seminar will be reflected in the global conference in October in Geneva, Switzerland.
The WIPO, as the international body that can move international copyright legislation forward, can play an important role here.
The seminar took place in Singapore on 29-30 April and was the first in a series of regional workshops organised by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).
To prepare for the event, EI published an infographic that portrays how copyright law affects 10 educational activities in 10 countries in Asia-Pacific.
Together with representatives from Communia , the International Federation of Library Associations, the International Council on Archives, the International Council on Museums, EI stressed that copyright laws often do not match the reality of the concerned sectors and that this needs to be changed so that their public missions can be fulfilled.
EI and a delegation of affiliates will be attending all regional WIPO meetings (Kenya, 12-13 June; the Dominican Republic, 4-5 July).
Restrictive laws and digital locks were discussed as major obstacles to the right to education and research.
Government delegates acknowledged that copyright laws need to be improved to ensure that educators and researchers can provide quality education and research.
EI has been advocating for such an approach and recently endorsed a draft treaty on copyright exceptions and limitations for educational and research activities that could be used as a basis of discussion at WIPO.
It also requires support for teachers to feel free to prepare and use any resources necessary to teach their students in order to provide quality education.
The conference highlighted, in the strongest possible terms, the importance of access to copyrighted work - analogue, digital, or in any other form - for teaching, learning, and research.
International action is essential in order to address the challenges that educators and researchers face when working with copyright-protected materials.
That was the finding of a recent regional seminar on copyright exceptions for education, research, libraries, archives and museums.
The discussions on education and research centred on principles of fair access and use of copyrighted work as a fundamental part of the right to education.
This conference will then provide guidance to WIPO's Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights on what actions will need to be taken at WIPO in the context of education, research, libraries, archives and museums.

The situation in Palu is still not stable.
But, for now victims are struggling with meeting their most basic needs; obtaining clean water and food.
If you wish to help PGRI with its rebuilding efforts, you can also make a financial contribution through EI's special solidarity fund account:
You may send your solidarity and support messages to PGRI at pbpgri@pgri.or.id , with copies to Dr. Unifah at unifah@pgri.or.id .
Education International's Asia-Pacific Regional Office has been in contact with Dr. Unifah Rosyidi, the President of EI affiliate Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia (PGRI, Teachers' Association of the Republic of Indonesia).
"Education International (EI) is counting on your solidarity with brothers and sisters in Central Sulawesi," wrote EI General Secretary David Edwardsin a letter dated5 October, World Teachers' Day, and sent to all member organisations.
"[My union],PGRI, is currently collecting donations and [supplies] from its members, and preparing a group of volunteer teachers to do trauma counselling.
Dr. Unifah further explained that PGRI's National Board is working together with the organisation's local unions to set up a crisis centre: "We want it to be the centre of disaster relief activities with the following priorities:1) to gather facts and data about teachers, their families, students, and schools affected by the earthquake, 2) to distribute supplies and equipment, 3) to provide trauma counselling to teachers and students, 4) to enrol temporary teachers with experience teaching in emergency situations."
Commercial airplanes cannot fly in/out of Palu, phone connections also still not [operational], which makes it difficult to help the victims… We try to do our best to help the people of Palu," Dr. Unifah said, describing ongoing relief efforts.
PGRI has mobilised its membership around the country to raise funds and collect donations.‘We expect our efforts to make a difference for the victims of the earthquake and tsunami, especially teachers and students,' Dr. Unifah wrote.
With EI support, PGRI is assessing the current situation and preparing to help educators in Central Sulawesi rebuild their lives.
After the major earthquake off the coast of Central Sulawesi produced a tsunami that killed over 1,400 people, Education International has called for solidarity from its affiliate to help affected teachers.

Introduction
Education Policy Paper
In 2003, EI launched a Europe for Education campaign which has resulted in the passing of a resolution at the European Parliament on increasing development cooperation towards education programs.
Any economic policy that privatizes and reduces public investment in education will marginalize children and adults living in poverty while reducing the quality of public education.
For more information, visit the GCE Global Action Week web site: http://www.globalactionweek.org/
Governments should implement the recommendation of the Delors Commission to allocate at least 6% of their GNP to education; today, the majority of the governments fail to achieve this level of investment.
EI sits on the Advisory Board of UNESCO's EFA Global Monitoring Report, a publication which provides a yearly assessment of the EFA process, and is also part of the UNESCO EFA Steering Committee.
Every year in April, together with its GCE partners, EI organizes a Global Action Week by mobilizing its affiliated organizations around the world to rally politicians and governments to fulfil their promise made in Dakar, Senegal, to provide education to all children by 2015.
The alliance represents organisations active in nearly 200 countries, including Education International, Oxfam International, Action Aid International, the Global March Against Child Labour, and dozens of regional and national NGO coalitions.
At the dawn of the new millennium, Education International and its broad coalition of teacher unions, and non-governmental organisations joined forces to launch the Global Campaign for Education (GCE).
The Dakar Framework for Action, calling for the achievement of EFA goals by 2015, requires a great global effort, joining the forces of all governments, civil Society, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and education unions, and intergovernmental agencies, including the UN with its specialised agencies and programmes.
Free quality basic education is also a prerequisite for lifelong learning, as people need to develop sufficient skills to be able to participate fully in society.
Several global measures have to be put in place to achieve education for all: developed countries must write off the official debts of the least developed countries, with resources thus saved re-allocated to education and other public services, all developed countries should allocate at least 0.7% of their GDP to development assistance and regressive lending policies of international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank must be reformed as they jeopardize the public provision of education.
One of the principal aims of Education International is to promote the right to education for all persons in the world.
EI advocates for free quality public education for all.
Several obstacles hinder access to quality education for all, notably the shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure and resources and gender inequality, with the world-wide illiteracy rate for women far higher than that for men.
Free quality basic education is one of the best solutions for combating child labour.
Two education unions in Kenya have called for a complete lockdown of the country to ensure the safety of educators and students.

SENA has also expressed its reservations because not all homes have radio or television, not all pupils have IT equipment, and not all towns are connected to the internet.

He also recalls that the ministry's approach is in line with the main guidelines established by Education International on the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly principles 4, 5 and 6.
This pilot study will initially involve students in exam classes - the 5th year of primary school (CM2) and students in the 3rd and final years of secondary school.
Finally, the union asks its members to observe the lockdown and to use barrier measures.
For Mve Messa, "students who cannot benefit from this education must not be penalized when courses start again in education facilities".
"Because it's a matter of keeping children usefully occupied during the lockdown and the COVID-19 pandemic, we don't see any problem with trying out this way of working, although we are aware it will not reach the whole target audience," said Fridolin Mve Messa, the General Secretary of SENA.
Mve Messa adds that SENA "believes the reorganisation of the school calendar is the only possible alternative following this health crisis, asks the minister to begin to consider the issue with the different parties involved, and also asks him to take into account their remarks and observations about distance learning".
For greater safety and caution, when it comes to restarting courses after COVID-19, SENA also urges the government to take all necessary preventive measures to protect students and teachers by installing water points and making alcohol hydrogel available.
The decision was made after meetings between the ministers responsible for education and their social partners - the teachers' unions to provide information and explanations.
He insisted that although the ministry's home-schooling experiment is worth trying, it must not be used as a way of completing the school year, but only in order to achieve its aim of keeping students learning.
Distance courses began on Tuesday, 14 April following the suspension of in-school lessons by the public authorities throughout the country to keep pupils and teachers safe from the spread of COVID-19 in schools.
The communication channels and support for distance learning are listed, in a letter to teachers and SENA members dated 16 April.
Although they believe the XGEST platform distance learning initiative launched by the Ministry of Education is worth trying out during the COVID-19 initiative, teachers, through their representative organisation, the Syndicat de l'Éducation Nationale say that they have strong reservations as to whether all students can access it.

"Teachers are few.
One thousand teachers die from AIDS each year.
There are lots of ways to motivate teachers," he said.
"My salary was inadequate so I went to Botswana and got myself a job.
"Many teachers that the government trained have since decided to leave the country and serve in other countries," says Chisenga.
He says that his school needs at least another five science teachers and five mathematics teachers, but the school has only been able to find two for each subject.
Delegates at EI's Africa Regional Conference in Brazzaville, Congo, are debating ways in which to address the enormous challenges facing education and educators across the continent.
All of this is aggravated by the decimation of a generation by the AIDS pandemic: a report by the National AIDS Council indicates that 40 per cent of Zambian teachers are HIV positive.
We need to do more to try and retain the few teachers that we have," she said, underlining that pay is not the only issue for teachers, who are also demotivated by a lack of materials and equipment in classes.
"Government needs to ensure that they put in place competitive conditions of service to keep our teacher in the system.
And most trained teachers have ambitions of leaving the country.
in the past two years, Zambia's education ministry has deployed 20,000 teachers across the country to replace those who have left or died.
Zambia currently has 15 government-run teacher education colleges.
That is what led Chisenga to first leave the country after seven years of teaching in Zambia's second largest city, Ndola.
"For instance, government started a program giving solar panels to teachers in rural areas so that they have things like electricity.
Roy Mwaba, General Secretary of the Zambia National Union of Teachers, an EI affiliate, has called on the government to quickly improve working conditions for Zambia's teachers.
This amount, teachers say, is too low to sustain even a small family in the face of high inflation and high cost of living, especially in places like Lusaka and the Copperbelt Provinces.
Patrick Nyambe is head teacher at Lusaka's South End School, which has 600 pupils.
You find that Zambia still has colleges offering two-year training.
Low pass rates in science and mathematics are evidence of how the shortage is affecting the quality of education.
A recent media report told the story of a teacher in a rural district where a teacher who had only completed grade seven was teaching primary school, so desperate is the need for staff.
On average, a teacher with a diploma qualification receives a salary equivalent to US$400 per month, with housing and other allowances adding another US$100 to monthly pay.
Those are small but important things that need to be enhanced, apart from just looking at take-home pay."
It costs US$10,000 dollars over three years to train a Fine Arts or English language teacher at Lusaka's Evelyn Hone College, while training a science teacher at the University of Zambia costs even more.
As Zambia strives towards achieving quality education it is important that the government seriously implements measures that will address teacher motivation in order to prevent more personnel from seeking economic refuge in the region given the economic cost the loss of teachers has on the future of the education system.
The demand is so high because of the exodus of teachers from the country.
The average ratio is one teacher to 60 pupils in high schools.
A large number of trainee teachers are beneficiaries of the government bursary system but they have no obligation to take a public school teaching post after completing their studies.
Zambia's government faces a massive challenge in finding people to take charge of the more than 250,000 students enrolled in high schools across the country.
"The education system in Zambia is such that they put up schools where they have not provided the necessary equipment to make a teacher of science enjoy his work.
That's for primary school, but those are the teachers that are filling in to teach science in schools.
As they upgrade these basic schools, they should upgrade the equipment, the science labs and all that."
Additional training is available from the University of Zambia.
One case study is Zambia, whose efforts to strengthen its education system are likely to flounder unless it finds a way to retain skilled teachers like Caroline Chisenga, a mathematics teacher with ten years of experience.
Mathematics and science teachers top the numbers of those who leave in search of better conditions of service, leaving a huge dent in staff numbers at public schools.
We need to train more teachers to fill the gaps."
I served there for a year, and while I couldn't sign a second contract, I got some good money and decided to come back home." Chisenga says she made as much as US$1,500 per month in Botswana.
If anything, I still look forward to taking another chance out there because there is good money."
"That's how serious the situation is and this has led to a negative impact in schools.
From his South End School, Nyambe agrees.
"We are currently looking at the teacher-pupil ratios.
So you find that this is part of the frustration which is there.

"In 1993 it wasn't absolutely sure that it would be possible to have this organisation operate effectively with such an ideological diversity, but we did," says van Leeuwen during the podcast. "
"Teaching has become a global profession, teachers need to take part in the conversation that's currently taking place about the future of the profession."
From deciding on leadership roles in a bar in Amsterdam to the stages needed for EI to become a power at the global stage, he moves through the intricate history of the world's largest professional organisation.
From the seeds of its creation in the early 1980s to its formation in Stockholm Sweden in 1993, Education International (EI)'s outgoing General Secretary Fred van Leeuwen sat down to reflect on the past and consider the future of the organisation and the teaching profession.
The podcast pulls back the curtain on stories never before shared by van Leeuwen.

The Education International affiliate has launched an online campaign providing accurate information about the disease and the best ways in which students, teachers and the public can protect themselves from infection.
Today we're at a turning point - health and education workers must be supported."
The statement calls for the Spring Meetings to mark a turning point in the Bank's response to the crisis.
The IFIs must promote and support public systems through increased investment.
It is vital to ensure individuals have the skills necessary to contribute to the economy and is a social equaliser.
It underlines that relief should enhance not restrict public spending including for education.
Yet today the world relies on critically important public services to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 23 March 2020, the World Bank president, David Malpass, responded to the fast-developing health and economic crisis by calling for structural adjustment and deregulation.
He said "countries will need to implement structural reforms to help shorten the time to recovery and cerate confidence that the recovery can be strong.
David Edwards, General Secretary of Education International said: "Underfunded and understaffed health and education systems in far too many low-income countries are the result of structural adjustment, conditionalities of IMF loans, debt servicing agreements and the policy prescriptions of the World Bank.
A debt workout mechanism, debt relief and debt swaps are essential to enable governments to take the measures necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030."
Rather than pushing structural adjustment measures, unions urge the IFIs to take a human approach, protecting workers and public systems.
Education International and global union partners call on international finance institutions to coordinate an urgent and equitable response to the COVID-19 crisis
The statement recognises that alongside the health and economic crisis, COVID-19 has led to a crisis in education.
Those countries that have excessive regulations, subsidies, licensing regimes, trade protection or litigiousness as obstacles, we will work with them to foster market choice and faster growth prospects during recovery."
"Though schools, universities and other education institutions are closed across the globe, education remains a key driver for the achievement of all SDGs.
It also notes that World Bank advice on public spending has contributed to the casualisation the education workforce and calls on the Bank to encourage governments to protect the jobs of workers in the education sector, especially those that are on precarious contracts.
It urges governments not to deprioritise education and to ensure that the rights of education workers are protected during school closures.
It calls for debt forgiveness as the foundation for an enabling environment but notes that debt swaps can also have potential where countries have robust national development strategies.
Governments must ensure that all education workers have their salaries, terms and conditions of employment protected during education institution closures and that measures are taken to mitigate the disruption in learners' education caused by the pandemic.
In a statement released ahead of the (virtual) Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Global Unions including Education International have called on the international finance institutions (IFIs) to take action for economic stimulus, debt relief and healthcare.
Global unions urge the IFIs to protect jobs and the real economy, take rapid measures for health and social protection, and provide debt relief for survival and sustainable development, as the world is hit by the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, the statement calls for a twin approach of sweeping SDG debt relief and a sovereign debt workout mechanism, including cancellation, restructuring, and reprofiling of debt owed to IFIs.
It urges the IFIs to reorient debt relief toward patient investment for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), backed by genuine progress on international corporate tax reform, progressive domestic mobilisation and financial regulation.

The 8th World Congress of Education International (EI), meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, from 21st to 26th July 2019:
However, in this era of global climate change, member organisations are urged to be even more prepared to give support as we face the challenge of an increasing number of natural disasters each year.
Without protection, displaced children can face perilous circumstances, such as exploitation and trafficking;
Schools provide safe spaces for children; a support system for particularly vulnerable children, such as those separated from their families; and access to lifesaving health and security information.
(i) Develop a web portal that provides access to "disaster relief" toolkits and other resources created by member organisations;
(iv) Recognise that many member organisations have generously responded to EI's appeals for financial contributions to disaster relief funds.
(7) Alarmed that the post-disaster environment has been used as a cover for the so-called reorganising of school systems, but this is in fact an opportunity for profit-seeking private corporations to remake what should remain a public resource.
Education can prepare children and their families for natural disasters and mitigate the impacts once devastation has struck;
(5) Declaring that reopening schools, when safe, should be one of the primary priorities of disaster recovery.
(2) Recording that hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, Idai and Kenneth were among the most destructive in our regions' history, leading to more than 3,000 deaths, and more than $500 billion dollars in damages; Mexico, Latin America and Africa have suffered from several severe earthquakes in recent years; super-storm Sandy caused more than $300 million dollars of damage in the Caribbean, before devastating the east coast of the U.S.; climate change in Canada is having unpredictable ecological and economic effects on croplands, and there is uncertainty over the effect of warming in the Arctic zone; flooding has caused millions of dollars in damage in Texas, Louisiana, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa, while fires have raged out of control in the western states of the US; 2018's disasters have extended as far as Hawaii, where lava from the Kilauea volcano destroyed hundreds of homes in a fortnight;
(6) Affirming that education plays a critical role in disaster preparedness and recovery.
(1) Observing that in recent years, countries in the North America and the Caribbean region have experienced natural disasters including earthquakes, storms, flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, disease pandemics and epidemics, as well as human-triggered environmental disasters; we note that their frequency and severity are increasing;
Privatisers and profiteers have attempted take-overs in school systems after hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, in earthquake-torn Honduras, and in Puerto Rico following hurricane Maria.
(ii) Intensify EI's Global Response campaign to monitor and report the actions of governments who the post-disaster restoration of education to the private sector;
(iii) Ensure that EI's Development Cooperation programme will foster capacity building programmes for member organisations in addressing preparation before natural disasters, and protection and safety during the occurrence and post-disaster recovery; and

"On the one hand, there are huge surpluses, and on the other hand, there are thousands of HDAA students who do not have access to services.
I feel that there is a simple solution to this problem: it is necessary to massively re-invest in education.
The spokespersons of the CSQ's school network all denounced "the indecent surpluses accumulated by the government, to the detriment of public services".
She also stated that over 88% of all education staff have reported witnessing a lack of support for students experiencing difficulties every day, and 86.5 percent have reported that students in their school or centre are still awaiting professional or support services to which they are entitled.
"Last June, Minister [of Education, Recreation and Sport of Quebec Sébastien] Proulx presented his long-awaited Policy on educational Success", recalled Chabot, emphasising the fact that "having a vision is a good thing, but it is time to take action".
This is why CSQ President Louise Chabot, the President of the Federation of Education Trade Unions Josée Scalabrini, the President of the Federation of School support staff Eric Pronovost, and the President of the Federation of education professionals of Quebec Johanne Pomerleau together demanded that the government of Quebec take action in the education sector.
Noting that the growth rate of education spending is lower than system costs, they emphasized that the amounts accumulated would be much better invested in support services for students.
Supporting disabled students and students experiencing difficulties in adapting and learning difficulties
Increasing government investment in student support services
The government must make good on its promises", said Chabot.
The survey conducted with the general public found that 83 percent of respondents believed that the government's investments aimed at supporting HDDA students are insufficient.
Two surveys conducted by the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ), one involving the general population and the other involving members of the education network, have demonstrated that there is great concern about the issue of disabled students and students experiencing difficulties in adapting or learning difficulties (known as HDDA in French), and in particular by the lack of access to services that they need to help them succeed.
With close to one million students back in Quebec schools, education trade unions are reminding the provincial government of its need to keep its promise to ensure quality education for all.
"Calling Educators to Action on Climate Crisis", by Gustavo E. Fischman, Daniel Fischer, Iveta Silova and Jordan King.
The site will be updated regularly as more information from Government and exam bodies is received.
Many parents also have concerns about their children and young people's wellbeing and what can be expected from this year's exams and assessment.
"This is not education as we know it, but headteachers and teachers, working alongside Government, are doing all they can to ensure children and their families are not unnecessarily stressed or anxious," said Courtney.
The union is working around the clock, mobilising regional and local structures to consult and support its members during the crisis.
The NEU's new microsite aims to give families some clarity on what they and their children could be doing and to alleviate some concerns.
The website also answers many of the pressing questions being asked by families and advises on exams and assessment, learning outside of school, child wellbeing and mental health, support for students with special educational needs and/or disability, and communication with schools.
COVID-19
The NEU has reported a significant increase in the number of new members, requests for advice from existing members and a surge in website and social media traffic.
"In these difficult times, many parents and carers are struggling to make sense of what home learning should look like," stressed Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the NEU.
Among the resources to support home learning are tips from NEU members - teachers and teaching assistants - on how parents can support their children to continue to engage in learning during this period.
Educators turning to their union for support during the crisis
On 6 April, the National Education Union (NEU) launched its coronavirus microsite to provide advice and resources to parents to support home learning.
The National Education Union in the United Kingdom has launched a website specifically addressing issues linked to the COVID-19 pandemic that parents and guardians of students may have.
Failure to protect them will increase the spread of the disease.
The world is facing an immediate and potentially huge crisis.
The global response must put this at the forefront.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that COVID-19 could cause an economic crash similar to the 2008 recession.
Special attention must be given to the situation of migrant workers, many of whom are particularly vulnerable.
The Council of the Global Unions (CGU), representing 200 million workers around the world, calls upon governments to:
Workers must be able to return to their habitual place of work as soon as is practicably possible should local and/or national containment measures financially or logistically inhibit them from doing so.
The rapid and wide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease that it causes require an urgent global response to protect health and stimulate the economy.
The CGU calls upon employers to:
The spread of the virus into the poorest countries, where infrastructure and sanitation are inadequate, risks catastrophic impacts on hundreds of millions of people.
Workers and their workplaces are central to this.
Governments must rise to the challenge to tackle the crisis today and to prepare and prevent future disease crises.
The global economy needs economic stimulus that reaches the real economy, workers and small businesses, and prioritises employment, livelihoods and communities.
As the impact of the virus spreads further, dialogue between unions, employers and government and collective bargaining are vitally important in protecting workers' health and their rights at work."
In addition, the huge strains on health systems caused by COVID-19 are likely to provoke new public health challenges.
All workers, where necessary, should be provided free medical testing, treatment, training, equipment and facilities for training, especially if they are performing medical services.
Cooperate and engage with multilateral institutions and increase aid to countries less able to respond to the threats posed by COVID-19 and ensure that the multilateral financial institutions assess national needs and respond appropriately.
While workers in every sector are exposed to risk, it is health and care workers who will bear the immediate brunt of the mitigation and treatment needs.
The privacy and personal information of workers must be protected as they undergo medical and other examinations and checks as part of responses to the threat posed by COVID-19.
Special provision must be made to immediately extend paid sick-leave entitlements to workers who lack them, and to improve sick leave provisions where they exist as well as to ensure working conditions and arrangements that provide protection.
Governments and employers must act to protect workers and tackle transmission in workplaces.
Involve workers' representatives in processes to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for COVID-19 threats and the evaluation of employer and government responses;
Protect wages and full pay for all workers through a variety of means, mutually agreed through collective bargaining;
Workers who rely on platform businesses for their employment should have access to social protection and to compensation from funds which are paid for by the platform businesses themselves.
Guarantee paid leave, in the form of sick pay or holiday pay, from the first day of leave, for any workers threatened or infected by COVID-19;
Recognise and exercise their duty of care for all workers in their business and supply chains and maintain contracts with suppliers, prioritising the rights and welfare of these workers in their response to the threats posed by COVID-19;
Immediately extend paid sick leave entitlements, maintain incomes and extend social protections to all workers, including formal, ‘gig', precarious and informal workers, regardless of their employment status;
Workers are on the frontline of the economic, social and health impacts of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
Recognise and bargain with trade unions to identify threats to workers health, rights and welfare, and to develop and implement workplace responses;
Income support for all workers, including for part-time, migrant, non-resident, precarious, ‘gig' and informal workers, is essential.
Establish compensation funds for all workers, including non-standard forms of employment and work-related contracts, that are adversely impacted by COVID-19 and the responses to it; and,
Enact stimulus packages with state spending that aims to sustain jobs and the economy, protecting wages, the welfare of workers, and small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs); and,
The need for governments to act together and through multilateral institutions to shore up the economy and keep people in work is clear.
Ensure health protections and plans are in place and are followed without exception;
Offer customised and responsible workplace and working arrangements for all workers.
In many countries healthcare funding is insufficient or people have no healthcare, and even where health systems are amongst the best, the impacts of COVID-19 could be overwhelming.
Mobility in higher education must not become a market.
Education must be truly inclusive - accessible and safe for all groups, including girls, minorities, people with disabilities and the marginalised;
It must be available to all, not just the privileged few.
The event will unfold over two weeks, with six Commissions, four Committees and about 25 side events involving Heads of States and more than 150 ministers.
From 12-27 November 2019, UNESCO's General Conference is hosting delegations from 193 countries to decide on some of the most pressing issues of today.
Inclusion and mobility in higher education: a long road ahead
Governments have to be particularly vigilant when it comes to the exploitation of international students and the charging of exorbitant fees by recruitment agencies and higher education institutions.
Holst emphasised the need to protect and promote academic freedom and professional autonomy, enabling academics and researchers to carry out research and teaching without interference.
In particular, the session discussed the Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education foreseen to be adopted during the General Conference this year.
Education is high on the agenda, with the meeting of the 2030 Steering Committee which took place 11-12 November, numerous key education issues addressed during the Education Commission - a high-level meeting dedicated to inclusion and mobility in higher education - and a special session on Saturday 16 dedicated to the launch of a global framework on professional teaching standards, hosted jointly by Education International (EI) and UNESCO.
Ensuring quality in higher education means providing for appropriate terms and conditions of employment and professional rights, alongside the lines defined by the ILO 1997 Recommendation on higher education.
Governments should address precarious employment in the sector and ensure that academics and researchers have permanent contracts, as well as security of tenure.
Stressing that educators are strong supporters of inclusion and mobility in education, Holst pointed out some key issues that must be addressed if the aim of the Education 2030 agenda of "leaving no one behind" is to be achieved:
The high-level meeting on inclusion and mobility in higher education aimed to highlight and strengthen the role that the higher education community must play in addressing the key challenges and opportunities provided in Sustainable Development Goal 4.
Haldis Holst, EI Deputy General Secretary, shared the educators' perspective with Ministers and other stakeholders during a keynote address.
EI urged ministers to take action to make higher education more inclusive at the UNESCO general conference today.
Debt service relief has been granted to : Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, D.R., The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Togo, and Yemen.
Emergency debt relief for all low-income countries now!
In Niger, for example, an increase in debt servicing of 31 % resulted in a 41 % decrease in education expenditure in the period 2015-17 ( Eurodad , 2020).
In addition, we would like to see a plan for continued systematic and comprehensive debt relief in the future to resolve the debt crisis so that no country is burdened by unsustainable debt.
Concurrently, education expenditure often depends on the levels of debt servicing.
Education International, together with over 200 civil society organisations has called for the permanent cancellation of all external debt payments to be made in 2020.
This requires the IMF and World Bank to produce a clear plan to coordinate extensive debt relief but also to protect jobs and the real economy and take quick action to support health, education and social protection.
However, Education International urges the IMF to go further and cancel debt for more countries and for longer and the G20 to follow suit and commit to a cancellation of official bilateral debt at their meeting this week.
Importantly, debt servicing was undermining governments' ability to ensure rights to health and education even before the pandemic; according to the Jubilee Debt Campaign , 64 lower income countries spend more on external debt payments than they spend on healthcare.
The International Monetary Fund Executive Board announced yesterday that it has approved immediate debt relief to 25 of the world's poorest countries to help address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The debt relief allows governments to spend money on crucial public services such as health, education and social protection, instead of debt servicing.
Without more extensive debt relief, many low-income governments will be forced to continue servicing international debt obligations instead of taking the necessary steps to safeguard their citizens from the effects of COVID-19.
The IMF urged donor countries to contribute more to the Trust, which can currently provide approximately $500 million in debt-service relief.
Grants will be given to cover IMF obligations for an initial phase of six months, under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT).
With the Spring Meetings currently underway, Education International urges the International Financial Institutions not to miss this opportunity to take decisive action to support all countries to protect their citizens during this global crisis.
We also urge Finance Ministers of donor countries to step up and show leadership and solidarity by answering the IMF's call to increase contributions to the underfunded Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust.
Education International welcomes the move, which is essential to enable the poorest countries to protect their citizens and ensure their rights during the coronavirus crisis.
Last week, EI joined the ITUC in calling for the International Financial Institutions to take a comprehensive, swift and humane response to the multifaceted COVID-19 crisis.
Solidarity in the midst of a global crisis
In addition, contributions are expected from other sectors, organisations and communities that wish to participate in the Solidarity Fund initiative.
"As teachers, we represent hope and become stronger in the face of challenges.
Furthermore, FECODE considers it essential that the government take major action in the national economy, using resources from international reserves, reversing the tax reform, distributing the profits of the Bank of the Republic and Ecopetrol, and renegotiating public and private debt, among other measures.
FECODE stands in solidarity with and joins thousands of others who have tried to help those most in need of assistance in the wake of this pandemic", reads the statement from the trade union federation.
In response to the critical situation in Colombia as a result of COVID-19, with millions of people struggling with the self-isolation and quarantine requirements of the pandemic, the Federación Colombiana de Trabajadores de la Educación, FECODE, has created a "Humanitarian Solidarity Fund" to meet the needs of health workers, the educational community, informal workers and the most vulnerable sectors of the population in general.
"Solidarity is something inherent; it comes in practice and at the right time", the FECODE Executive Committee declared in its statement.
The fund will also be supplemented by donations from FECODE executives, consultants, work teams and staff.
The teachers' union calls on all political, financial and industrial sectors, as well as the national government, to make prompt and informed decisions and avoid acting on greed and financial motivations.

"This moment of global crisis should give us ample opportunity to create new lessons on how we are consuming our planet's resources; on how research, education, health, basic sanitation and drinking water should be adequately financed by the government, and have a profound social focus, prioritising the public and protecting the environment", the statement adds.
FECODE has also called on Colombian teachers to donated one day's pay by authorising a special payroll deduction.
According to the President of FECODE, guidelines regarding the administration, supervision, monitoring and verification of the destination of the funds will be drawn up in the next few hours.
Nelson Alarcón, president of FECODE (a member organisation of Education International), announced on Monday the decision taken by the union's Executive Committee to establish the humanitarian fund with an initial sum of $300 million.
Regional unions will contribute to the fund to the extent of their financial capacity.
The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), a member organisation of Education International, has launched a media campaign to raise awareness and educate teachers and school communities about COVID-19.

In addition, the union highlighted the crucial role of education workers during these difficult times.
To this end, the Ministry of Education must fulfil its coordinating role, especially when these public employment offers originate from a formal government agreement.

Furthermore, the government must ensure that neither jobs nor signed contracts awaiting implementation are lost.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the world, with over 94,000 confirmed cases and around 8,000 deaths as of 31 March 2020.
Schools have been closed since 12 March, affecting some 10 million students who are currently being supported by around 700,000 educators working from home.
The union has also requested clarity on the announcement of open competitions for 2020 and has asked that, regardless of when they are held, the decision be the same for all the autonomous communities.
The education union has also published a Practical Guide to Education Workers' Rights that answers questions such as "Are education departments and universities obliged to allow teleworking?
In one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 health crisis, the Spanish education union FECCOO is negotiating with the government regarding measures to ensure the sustainability of the education system and has launched a guide with advice for teachers.
", "Can you refuse to go to work if the employer forces you to?
FECCOO is also seeking government approval for around 80,000 positions to be filled over the next three years, so that increases in staffing levels are also taken into account and not just pension schemes and the stabilisation of the teaching profession.
"Teachers are facing this health crisis as they do everything else: with professionalism, determination and in many cases imagination in order to overcome the challenges of teaching in these difficult times", stressed the trade union, a member organisation of Education International (EI).
Federación de Enseñanza de Comisiones Obreras (FECCOO) has called for the closure of all schools and has asked that neither teachers, including management personnel, nor non-teaching staff are asked to go to work.

EI members devastated by tropical storm in Central America
Early estimates suggest that 180 people have been killed, most of them in Guatemala, and more than 100,000 people are homeless.
A number of indigenous Indian communities also felt the full force of powerful mudslides in the department of Chimaltenango, a province west of Guatemala City, and many there are still missing.
The country's infrastructure has been badly affected as artery roads are blocked, and bridges have collapsed.
Tens of thousands of others are living in temporary shelters, either because their homes were destroyed or because they were evacuated from areas at risk of flooding.
From the aftermath it is clear that Guatemala has been the worst-hit.
EI is working to provide emergency assistance to STEG in order to help it get off the ground, to reorganise and support its teacher members, and the wider humanitarian effort.
EI members and emergency workers in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are struggling to get aid to communities cut off by Tropical Storm Agatha which battered the region over the weekend.
Although the storm has passed more rain is forecast and officials warn that swollen rivers continue to pose a risk of flooding and landslides.
Guatemala's devastation comes on the back of week which saw the eruption of the Pacaya volcano which started last Thursday and has already hindered aid efforts.
Rescuers are digging through mud and rubble in search of dozens of people still missing after landslides destroyed entire communities.
EI will provide more detail on the situation of teachers and students in the region as we learn more.
In the capital, Guatemala City, a giant sinkhole opened up, reportedly swallowing a number of buildings.
This has hampered rescue efforts by land and made it difficult for aid agencies to reach the worst hit areas.
All three countries have declared emergencies in an attempt to increase immediate aid and resources and prevent the spread of dengue and malaria from the stagnant water.
EI member organisation, the Union of Education Workers of Guatemala (STEG), was among those badly affected as its offices in the capital were flooded, causing it considerable damage and the loss of all IT equipment.
The Fourth World Congress of Education International 8.
Resolution on the Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Teachers
The Fourth World Congress of Education International, meeting in Porto Alegre (Brazil) from 22 to 26 July 2004: 1.
Recalls that, in industrialised countries the phenomenon of the shortage of qualified teachers can be observed.
Notes that HIV/AIDS leads to reduced life expectancy with a consequent devastating impact on teacher supply in some parts of the world.
At the same time, the lack of attractiveness of the teaching profession and/or certain branches of education in several North American and European countries has already led some countries to "import" teachers from developing countries, and this in turn is exerting a downward pull on the living standards and working conditions of local teachers.
In this context to resort widely to the use of " voluntary teachers" or "community teachers" does nothing to ensure the necessary level of quality in education.
Recalls that implementing the objectives of Education for All (EFA) will require, in the developing countries, the recruitment of some 30 million new teachers whose professional profile, career and training should be given careful consideration.
Instructs the Executive Board to take appropriate initiatives at international level, in particular with intergovernmental organisations like UNESCO, ILO, the OECD and the World Bank, to attract, train and retain the most highly-motivated young people in teaching.
Recalls that teacher education is recognised as an important element of education policy in most higher education systems and a key to the development of the teaching profession and primary and secondary education systems.
Recalls that teacher scarcity and/or the practice of resorting to insufficiently qualified teachers have serious repercussions for the quality of teaching, which is a key issue in the context of globalisation and the political battle to uphold the public education service.
Considers nevertheless that the use of fixed-term contracts of employment for teachers in place of contracts based on collective agreements must be rejected.
Proposes, lastly, that special provisions and facilitating measures, including additional periods of study leave with full pay, be accorded to teachers who have received accelerated training, so as to enable them to complete their qualifications on an in-service basis.
Proposes, furthermore, that students admitted to fast-track training programmes be chosen according to the same criteria as those receiving standard training or even according to more rigorous criteria, so as to ensure that such students will be able to complete their education at a later stage.
Calls on the member organisations to engage the necessary consultations with their sponsoring departments to promote national efforts to develop the viability and quality of domestic teacher education and to assure that the recruitment and training of young teachers recognised as core components of public education systems.
Considers also that performance assessment of teachers, which must in no way lead to the individualisation of salaries, is entirely acceptable provided the type of and arrangements for assessment are laid down in collective agreements between the social partners.
Considers that makeshift solutions may be taken to address situations of urgency,especially in connection with achieving Education For All, provided they have been discussed and agreed on by ministries of education, teaching unions and, if relevant, international funding agencies.
Requests the Executive Board, in view of the teacher scarcity experienced in the developing countries, where pressing needs may necessitate the accelerated training of teachers, to reflect - in close cooperation with EI's member unions - on the conditions under which such practices might be acceptable.
Suggests, as a contribution to the debate on this issue, that such practices should be implemented only on condition that full training be provided for a certain proportion (to be determined on a national basis) of the new teachers so as to ensure the existence of a body of teachers sufficiently skilled to orient and guide the teaching profession as a whole.
d. Investigate and take up the challenge of Aids orphans, child headed households and vulnerable children in general - and means of training teachers to deal with this e. Develop strategies and policies on the roles and rights of educators in the school with regard to HIV/AIDS.
Recalls, furthermore, that the supply of teachers depends not only on the number of publicly financed teaching posts, but also on the attractiveness of teaching posts, which determines the number and quality of applicants and the ability to retain teachers in the posts concerned.
Recalls that the demand for teachers is a function of the number of children in need of schooling, but it also depends on the teacher/pupil ratio, the duration of education and the objectives of education.
Requests the Executive Board to: a. Facilitate research into the country specific factors driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic and best practice in combating the disease and changing behaviour - especially in the education sector b. Develop strategies to enhance the role of EI in the regions in supporting efforts of teacher unions to combat the pandemic c. Disseminate information and materials on best practice around advocacy, awareness, rights of those living with HIV, treatment, care and support strategies.
Resolution on Gender and HIV/Aids
The Fourth World Congress of Education International: 8.
Role of Education International 10.
Noting that the world will mark the 23rd anniversary of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in June 2004 and that according to recent UNAIDS estimations that 40 million people are living with the virus, and that the global epidemic killed more than 3 million people in 2003.
Considering also the quantity of data and expertise gained by Education International during the past nine years through the programme undertaken in conjunction with WHO and UNAIDS.
"If it can be said, as it can, that by the year 2020 the number of deaths [caused by HIV/AIDS] in Africa will approximate the number of deaths, military and civilians combined, in both World Wars of the 20th Century, then it should also be said that a pronounced majority of those deaths will be women and girls.
Convinced that women teachers and women education personnel affected by HIV/AIDS should not be considered only as victims because they could also be part of the measures aimed at effectively combating the discrimination and stigma that they could face, and that they have the right to participate in the development of such measures.
Also concerned by the situation of girls and young women students, and; 5.
The toll on women and girls is beyond human imagining; it presents Africa and the World with a practical and moral challenge which places Gender at the centre of the human condition [...]" STEPHEN LEWIS, UN Secretary General's Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, July 2002 The Fourth World Congress of Education International, meeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil from 22 to 26 July, 2004: 1.
Concerned by the extremely difficult situations that particularly women teachers and women education personnel affected by HIV/AIDS could face at school, in the union, and in society at large.
EI should: a. Strengthen its collaboration with international organisations like ILO, WHO, UNAIDS, among others that deal with the gender dimension of HIV/AIDS; b. Participate at international and regional level in events related to gender and HIV/AIDS; c. Include the gender dimension of HIV/AIDS in developing cooperation programmes; d. Develop training activities and materials specifically for women to assist member organisations on the gender-related aspects of the pandemic.
Invites EI member organisations to: a. Spare no effort and to urge their governments to implement a prevention and education policy integrating sex education, with a gender perspective as well as teacher training programmes including the use of appropriate methods for education about health, life skills and HIV/AIDS; b. Include in collective bargaining negotiations issues related to the gender dimension of HIV/ AIDS and to train negotiation teams in this; c. Develop activities to deal specifically with the situations that face women teachers affected by HIV/AIDS; d. Firmly implement the EI Declaration on Professional Ethics and act to make school a safe and healthy place that guarantees to everybody protection from all forms of discrimination, harassment and violence and a friendly place in which to learn, work and live together.
Calls on governments to take effective measures to: a. Ensure equal and free access of girls and women to public, quality education, which includes scientific, informed programmes on human sexuality, in close consultation with teacher's unions; b. Prevent HIV infection of women and girls ensuring access to appropriate sexual education and to reproductive health care; c. Promote research for the development of effective microbicides; d. Facilitate access to condoms in order to reduce significantly risks of HIV transmission and slow down the pandemic; e. Ensure equal access of women and girls living with HIV or affected by AIDS to proper care and treatment; f. Ensure access to generic medication in less developed countries and fully implement the commitments of Doha; g. Reduce violence against women and girls at home, in schools, at the work place and in society at large, reducing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS; h. Conduct national estimates of HIV prevalence based on gender-sensitive and disaggregated data; i. Protect the economic rights of women and girls, ensuring property ownership and inheritance rights in the context of HIV/AIDS; j. Firmly combat trafficking on women and girls, child labour, forced marriage, sexual and economic exploitation and all forms of discrimination against women and girls that increase their vulnerability and could facilitate their exposure to HIV/AIDS.
Concerned by the alarming growth in the gender dimension of the pandemic, that women and girls are increasingly represented among the vulnerable, infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, in Sub-Saharan Africa (the region worst affected), that women and girls are twice as likely to be infected with HIV than men, and that among people aged 15-24, this ratio is highest.
Considering that the fundamental role that education must play in the prevention and elimination of all forms of discrimination that could face women and girls affected with HIV/AIDS, and that several studies conducted at national and international level have shown that the lack of education in general, and particularly on reproductive health and HIV prevention, increases the vulnerability of women and girls and have also highlighted the protective role that schools could play.

However, Pronovost highlighted that the 81 employment categories represented by the Federation remain too little known and recognised.
When all of the daily deliveries will have been made, the Minister will have a full set of 81 postcards.
Video of Quebec MP Alexandre Cloutier highlighting the work of school support staff:
Learning about the education support personnel's employment categories in 81 days
"Our public education network would not be what it is today without these workers working at all levels of our school system, day after day," said FPSS-CSQ President Eric Pronovost.
In order to remind the Minister of Education of the importance of recognising and valuing these employment categories, he will receive one postcard showcasing a specific employment category every day.
"Our members have great reason to be proud of what they are accomplishing, as they are making a difference in our schools and in our centres.
We would therefore like to thank them for their professionalism."
The Federation of school support staff (Fédération du personnel de soutien scolaire - FPSS-CSQ), affiliated to the Central trade union body of Quebec (Centrale des syndicats du Québec - CSQ), a member organisation of Education International (EI), rightly emphasised the essential work carried out by its 27,000 school support staff members.
The essential work carried out by school support staff - who ensure the proper functioning of schools on a daily basis - was highlighted in Canada on National School Support Staff Day in September.
This is a way of showcasing each person who contributes to school life in schools and education centres, and of creating a better understanding of the role played by each school support staff member in school boards.
Strong recognition was given to the crucial role played by educational support staff in the lives of educational establishments and their students during Quebec's National School Support Staff Day.
A call for greater solidarity

In response to the learning crisis, the Ministry of Education has put in place distance education programmes.
Alternative modes of education during the crisis are temporary measures that cannot replace the physical presence of students;
The Executive Board of Education International, meeting online on 3 April 2020:
The Education International Executive Board held an emergency webinar on Friday, 3 April.
Policymakers should put in place the global equivalent of the Marshall Plan in order to create the best possible conditions for an environmentally sound economic recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.
Politicians and other leaders to ensure that the end of the pandemic does not result in austerity measures that jeopardize public services;
Too many governments are ill-prepared to deal with an emergency on the scale of COVID-19;
The international community and its institutions have not reached a consensus on how to mobilise solidarity and address this global crisis;
Although teachers and education support personnel in some countries are being paid salaries and receiving benefits during this time, that is not the case in large parts of the world;
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to all regions of the world and the rates of infection and the number of deaths are accelerating and overwhelming the healthcare systems of many countries.
An important criterion for judging progress, during and after the pandemic, is whether work continues and accelerates on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 4 on education, which, with the crisis, have become more important than ever;
Governments to recognise that solidarity in the global community is a prerequisite for progress at home as well as for dealing with future crises;
In most countries, digital classes are still not possible due to the lack of computers, Internet and other online platforms and, in some countries, the exorbitant cost of data which limit access and opportunity;
EXECUTIVE BOARD RESOLUTION ON EI's RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The drive for quick profits rather than productive investment, has also contributed to social and environmental short-termism, including the erosion of commitment to public services and long-term planning;
Governments and employers to recognise that trade unions are an important part of the good functioning of democracy and that social dialogue and tripartism are instrumental in making society work well and resolve conflicts, particularly in times of crisis;
The response to this crisis is hampered by a legacy of neglect and under-funding of health and other public services as well as the lasting impact of austerity programs from the Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008;
The education community has been hit hard by COVID-19, with more than 1.5 billion students, 63 million teachers and large numbers of education support personnel affected due to quarantines, lockdowns, and school closures;
International Financial Institutions to make available monetary resources to fight the pandemic and its effects without crippling and/or damaging requirements or onerous conditions;
Governments to ensure that resources, both fiscal and human, are available after the pandemic is over to ensure full recovery of their education systems;
International and regional organisations to coordinate and cooperate to address this global pandemic with coherent and effective responses;
In order to develop good policy, sound research is crucial, by EI and member organisations, but also through influencing content, and helping generate funds for independent research by others.
Governments and employers to protect the rights and livelihoods of educators and support personnel and not use the pandemic as a reason to eliminate or weaken collective bargaining agreements negotiated and in place while, in fact, this crisis demonstrates the importance of collective bargaining and the role it plays supporting workers and their communities;
During the call, the Executive Board adopted a resolution outlining educators' key demands to all governments and international institutions dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak.
Governments to mobilise people and massive resources for assistance on health, including mental health, aid and solidarity at international, regional and national levels;
Often, teachers and ESP are at an elevated risk from COVID-19 due to advanced age or underlying illnesses, which may make it dangerous for them to work with people or, in other ways, have social contact;
Lack of trust of government and the media and the wide circulation of disinformation, have exacerbated problems in communicating and understanding vital public health information, especially where there was not enough initial transparency on the real dangers posed by COVID-19;
Governments to consult education unions about the process of school closures and the operation of reduced and modified education;
Governments and politicians to resist and oppose efforts to exploit fears and panic for personal electoral or partisan gain;
Many governments have not effectively addressed violence, beatings, and harassment in racist and "anti-foreigner" attacks perpetrated by extremist groups or individuals;
Governments, when dealing with the social and economic impact of the pandemic, to put all workers and their families first, including for salaries, incomes, and social protections;
School closures tend to re-enforce inequalities and, although use of digital means in some countries may help during this period, they will often be of less value to disadvantaged, special needs and other students requiring substantial personal attention, thereby increasing the digital divide;
This is a global crisis and a danger to anybody anywhere is a danger to everybody everywhere.
Even students with digital availability, competencies, and culture will lose precious interaction and social relationships with teachers, other education personnel and students;
Governments to not ignore or overlook the dangers of digitalisation and artificial intelligence to schools and education as well as to democracy in surveillance, violations of privacy, including of students and families, and other "temporary" practices;
Democracy, particularly in times when it may be "put aside" for the crisis, should be vigorously defended by all democratic forces, including trade unions, especially organisations of teachers and other education personnel that play an important role in both schools and communities.
Governments to make special efforts to protect the health and well-being of all vulnerable groups and persons in the population, including the elderly, refugees, migrants, the poor, disadvantaged, people with disabilities, women, especially women who are engaged in care or are victims of violence, indigenous peoples, and other excluded persons;
Governments to involve the education professionals and their unions in the policy and process of re-opening schools when the pandemic is over;
Some xenophobes, politicians, wealthy individuals or enterprises have and will continue to exploit this worldwide crisis to fuel fear and hatred and foster division for political advantage or to seek financial gain;
Governments to ensure that the accommodation of refugees and migrants, particularly in detention, in camps or other facilities, are improved to meet health and safety standards;
Millions of refugees and migrants are vulnerable because their environments do not provide adequate space, hygiene, or healthcare, particularly if they are confined in camps or other cramped facilities;
Governments to ensure that, in view of the existing digital divide, students are not disadvantaged in tests and examinations;
Governments to fill all open teacher positions despite the setback in the education and training of future teachers in a manner that maintains a high level of professional standards and qualifications
In densely populated and least developed countries, where reliable information is often not readily available, millions are endangered by crowding and poverty as well as inadequate health and hygiene facilities;
Mitigating the number of inflections requires measures that limit such exposure and contact, including social distancing, frequent hand washing and surface cleaning, quarantining, and the use of personal protective equipment for those providing essential services, especially for medical personnel and emergency services, and including school and early childhood care staff;
Basic leadership and political will to produce urgently needed personal protective equipment and critical medical devices, particularly for medical personnel and first responders, is often weak or non-existent;
Governments to avoid turning the unfortunate need to rely on digital and other forms of education due to COVID-19 into an excuse or justification to provide inferior education in the future;
Those engaged in precarious and insecure work, including some contingent staff, contract teachers, researchers and teaching assistants in higher education, early childhood teachers and Education Support Personnel (ESP) have become even more vulnerable with the crisis;
The virus is very contagious and spreads through the air, by touching surfaces with the live virus, and through human contact.
Where schools are still open, including in situations where they need to be available for children of essential, frontline workers and vulnerable children or where nutrition or other services are provided, children and teachers and education support personnel must be provided with adequate personal protective equipment to ensure safe and healthy environments;

EI's report "is a wake-up call to governments", said its General Secretary, David Edwards.
These conditions adversely affect all in the education community, but have an even bigger impact on women.
The study also shows how inequities in education continue to rise, replicating and producing inequities in society.
"While it is more accepted that education is essential, governments need to put their money where their mouths are."
"How the COVID-19 crisis may impact higher education unions' work and strategy on casualisation", by Rob Copeland.
David Edwards and deputy general secretary Haldis Holst were the hosts of a webinar that presented the report on October 4th.
The study, written by Professor Nelly P. Stromquist from the University of Maryland, is based on the results of a survey that includes the voices of 140 teacher organisations affiliated to EI, from early childhood through to higher education.
In addition, the report reveals common challenges faced by teachers worldwide such as poor working conditions, precarious contracts, inadequate teaching tools and high levels of stress.
Respondents voiced need for support particularly when it came to teaching students with special needs, followed by the development of their ICT skills and gender and sexuality training.
On World Teachers' Day, new report highlights urgent need to improve education
Over three-quarters (79 per cent) of African unions report that teachers have to travel long distances to collect their pay; almost two-thirds (64 per cent) cite inadequate housing, and poor access to latrines and water in schools.
He highlighted the growth of privatisation in the education sector and its iniquitous effects as an ongoing concern - 90 per cent of unions report an increase in education privatisation, with almost half of parents having to contribute either fully or partly to their children's educational costs.
Workload continues to rise, with four out of ten female teachers in Japan (41 per cent) reporting that their working environment adversely affected their experiences with pregnancy and childbirth.
All these issues contribute to making the profession unattractive to young people as well as causing attrition - both hugely problematic at a time when there is an urgent need to address the global shortage of qualified teachers in order to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4.
A staggering 617 million children and adolescents - nearly 60 per cent globally - have not mastered basic literacy or numeracy.
This critical issue was also highlighted in a ground-breaking report, Global Status of Teachers and the Teaching Profession , released by Education International (EI) on World Teachers' Day.
EI's new report highlights the urgent need for improvement in professional training - only one in three teachers (30 per cent) report having access to CPLD and 77 per cent see the CPLD they do receive as of poor quality and little value.
The urgency of this focus is underscored by the fact that more than 263 million children and youth worldwide are not in school.
The full report can be accessed here .
Teachers make quality education possible
It will be available here .
In her intervention as part of the panel, Marieme Sakho Dansokho, General Secretary of SYPROS, Senegal and Board member of EI, cited EI's recent global report on the status of teachers , where 78.8% of respondents reported that teaching was not an attractive profession.

The second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record has already caused 5 confirmed fatalities, 13,000 houses feared damaged or destroyed, major power cuts and a still unknow number of people who have had to abandon their homes.
"Investing in quality public education is investing in the future!
We also urge governments to take urgent action and make gender equality and inclusive education a reality!"
This resolution, co-authored and proposed by Nigeria and 58 other Member States, calls on all stakeholders, including UN Member States, UN agencies, and civil society, non-governmental organisations, academic institutions, the private sector, individuals and other relevant stakeholders to observe the International Day of Education.
On 3 December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted, with consensus, a resolution (Resolution 73/25), proclaiming 24 January as International Day of Education, in celebration of the role of education for peace and development.
"We as education unionists and professionals have the deep-rooted belief that education is a human right, a public good and a public responsibility," Edwards explained.
He added that EI is carrying out an assessment of SDGs and will be releasing a shadow report in July 2019 at the High-level Political Forum, the United Nations' central platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
"We warmly welcome the first ever International Day of Education," stressed Education International (EI) General Secretary David Edwards.
Education International and education unions worldwide celebrate the first ever International Day of Education, calling on governments to make quality public education for all a reality.
UNESCO, as the specialised UN agency for education, was tasked with facilitating the annual observance of the Day, in close collaboration with main education actors.
EI to governments: progress on SDG is too slow, act now!
"It is timely and overdue at the same time, as we are very much concerned about slow and uneven progress towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs)."
He went on to note that SDG4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all - is key to achieving all other SDGs.
On International Day of Education, EI is also broadcasting a webinar featuring EI Deputy General Secretary Haldis Holst and EI's Dennis Sinyolo, emphasising the global union federation and its affiliates' role as education experts, leaders and advocates in the field.
That is why today, on International Day of Education, we reiterate our call for governments to invest in education and teachers: qualified educators make quality education for all possible.
In Finland, the government announced a state of emergency on 16 March.
The education workforce is well protected and (for now) has financial security.
Norway: Cooperation and communication
Close dialogue with the government is ongoing, with two key issues to the forefront:
Denmark: Online assistance for union members
The online resources give advice related to health and on how to interact with children.
Unions and their members believe in the need to stand together, build trust and show social responsibility.
In Sweden, education unions have focused their efforts on emphasizing the role and safety of their members, since schools remain open to a large extent.
Day-care centres have stayed open but parents are asked to keep their children at home if possible.
In addition, most of the OAJ's own staff are now working remotely.
All schools, kindergartens and universities are closed, as part of emergency measures that will last until 13 April.
Nationwide school closures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 started on 18 March and are set to continue until 13 May.
Whilst many teachers were familiar with distance-based learning, it has been a new experience for others.
In addition, parents in jobs critical to the functioning of society who have young children can send their children to specially arranged care.
Sweden: Mix of open schools and distance learning
In the collective agreements, employers have a right to define where a teacher should undertake their work.
While local authorities have a mandate to call for school closures, unions have criticised this and called for national guidelines on whether schools should be closed or not.
They also outline ways for members to continue their teaching during the school closure.
The OAJ says employers must ensure that every teacher possesses the adequate skills and equipment to teach under these circumstances.
Links to the websites of local education authorities and UNICEF are provided and members are encouraged to follow all official advice on the COVID-19 crisis.
Distance teaching requires particular competency, knowledge, equipment, programmes, and education of teachers themselves.
In upper secondary and higher education, distance teaching/learning is being implemented and educational institutions are closed.
Finland: Dialogue about distance learning, day-care, and duties
Opetusalan Ammattijärjestö (OAJ) is fully supportive of the Government's decisions in this regard and, indeed, partook in discussions with the government in the run-up to the decision to close schools.
Students and teachers also all have access to whatever equipment they require and are using educational and school-based platforms.
Communication is also vital and the unions are cooperating with the education ministry and employers to provide professional advice to educators.
Education International's three member organisations in Norway - the Norwegian Association of Researchers, Skolenes Landsforbund and Utdanningsforbundet - are cooperating with their government and were consulted prior to the adoption of crisis packages by the Parliament.
Education unions in Nordic countries join forces with public authorities to fight COVID-19 pandemic
In the meantime, most education is now being delivered via distance teaching/learning.
Some local authorities have told teachers to deliver their distance teaching from the school premises.
Adjustments to the quarantine of students with particular special needs are also available.
Educators in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are using well-developed social dialogue channels and information technology to help curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Significantly, educators retain their salaries and rights when they transfer to distance-based teaching.
In Denmark, the Danish National Federation of Early Childhood and Youth Educators, the Danish Union of Teachers, the Dansk Magisterforening and the Gymnasieskolernes Laererforening - affiliates of Education International - have set up informative and easily accessible webpages focusing on educators' rights and practical information.
Education International's affiliates - Lärarförbundet, Lärarnas Riksförbund and the Swedish Association for University Teachers and Researchers - also provide up-to-date information on developments with links to the website of the education directorate (Skolverket).
This is not advisable in the current situation, and the OAJ has tried to convince employers to allow teachers to work from home. Whilst this happens in most instances, and employers trust their teachers, it is not universal.

"Handling the COVID-19 crisis in education: What can TALIS 2018 tell us?
He called for a transformation of the union "from the bottom up", and highlighted professionalisation as the most important issue.
However, they are against "anyone who attempts to go against the unity of the profession or pretends to take away any of our gains".
"There is a space [in the SNTE] for all those who want to build a better union," said Juan Díaz de la Torre, the union's newly elected President .
Over 3,700 SNTE delegates from all over the country participated in the congress.
They also agreed to maintain pressure on the federal government to stop the pauperisation of the teaching profession.
He also congratulated SNTE "for the success of this great democratic exercise and reiterate our willingness to continue strengthening the ties that unite us, working together for a stronger trade union movement".
February 2018 was a notable month for the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), as its VII Extraordinary National Congress, held from 12-14 February, brought in statutory reform and elected a new national leadership for 2018-2024.
They will undertake decisive actions, not only to guarantee education workers' job security and improve their quality of life, but also to strengthen the national education system.
During the congress, SNTE amended its constitution to become the first trade union in Latin America to ensure that women occupy 50 per cent of its leadership positions.
The SNTE leaders also committed to continue fighting for the recognition of education workers' rights and benefits, as expressed in the union's national list of demands for 2018.
"We have to stay united, keep fighting at national level, so that there is a national union of education workers that is solid, strong, active and alive, and allows us to feel proud.
"Teachers are in favour of public policies leading to the strengthening of public schools and education, and resources for professional training," stressed Díaz de la Torre.
The SNTE national governing bodies, in compliance with the mandate given by the national congress, held their first meeting.
In unity we stand, for the recognition, prevalence and strength of our organisation: for education at the service of the people."
Congratulating SNTE President for his election, EI General Secretary emeritus Fred van Leeuwen noted that "this result is a clear sign of the confidence you enjoy along with the Mexican teaching profession, which recognises your leadership and your determined work to make the SNTE an even more effective union in the defense of our profession and the struggle for a quality public education."
Focus on educators' professionalisation
At this, they outlined the union's 2018-2024 work plan, establishing as a priority union members' working conditions and professional development, as well as the defence of public education.
The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación, in an extraordinary Congress, modified its statutes, including adopting a provision that 50 per cent of its leadership positions must be held by women.
They elected their leadership and strengthened their commitment to achieve improved teachers' working and living conditions and quality public education.
The meeting is taking place today, 10 March.
This would be in line with decisions made in other European countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
Instead, new obligations are imposed, including bureaucratic ones.
Lastly, restrictions have been placed on visas for entering the country.
Colleagues from all over the country are also taking part in similar initiatives that will be launched throughout the week.
The public education system is also at risk of long-term damage.
"The recommendations are not very helpful because they are not very practical," she said.
"Today, we are paying a high price for that kind of inactivity."
A call for greater solidarity
The world is facing an unprecedented health emergency.
Among the findings of the survey, which attracted 1,359 responses:
Examples from Argentina
"We have published three numbers they can call from 8am to 8pm, any time they think their rights have been violated or they have any questions."
The JTU stressed that it will also be necessary to implement mental healthcare measures due to the long-term restrictions on the movement of people.
The task of continuing education in this difficult context is daunting but essential.
Lack of professionalism of government institutions
We will continue to work so that all children in Lebanon have access to education.
According to the union, the proposals do not offer any help in dealing with social inequalities.
However, not all teachers and students own a smartphone or a computer.
No matter where they come from, they all deserve a good education and all the opportunities it brings."
In Poland, like in many other countries, access to remote learning is often conditioned by wealth.
The data shows that the technology divide is one of the main hurdles in this context.
Those who can have been asked to provide food and assistance to those in need.
According to the ZNP, the government institutions have not coped well with the new tasks.
"Coronavirus Curriculum", by Felisa Tibbitts.
The union highlighted five areas to be urgently and addressed by the Education Ministry:
In addition, many families are losing their sources of income due to recommended social distancing measures.
The situation we are facing is challenging but we will not be deterred.
In the new circumstances, delivering the new curriculum seems impossible to achieve.
In addition, the curriculum at all levels will have to be adjusted in response to the new status quo in the country.
Delivering quality education to as many students as possible
It has also requested free internet access for all students and teachers until the end of the emergency situation.
In addition to the temporary schools' closures, the country has decided to ban social gatherings of more than 10 people.
"Many suggestions ignore the reality of our schools and do not honour their educational mission, focusing only on transitions and examinations."
The approach is to "provide quality education for all, including marginalized groups".
On 1 April, the National Teachers' Association of Liberia (NTAL) donated US$2,292 in personal protective equipment for education workers.
The organisations representing teachers regret that they were not consulted about the closure of schools.
To ensure that the digital gap is not keeping students from learning, the national strategy has centred on television programmes.
For the moment, the only schools closed are those where COVID-19 contamination has been detected.
Thanks to the early deployment of epidemic control actions by the government, schools in Taiwan remain open with strict measures to prevent infection.
For several years, the teaching community has warned that the new core curriculum was overloaded and difficult to implement in ‘normal' school conditions.
Governments must assess the situation in their countries and respond in an effective and proportionate way in order to contain the outbreak.
This is the case "particularly for those who lack the resilience, learning strategies or engagement to learn on their own".
According to Jawad Hussein, PPSTLL President, Lebanon's duty to cater to vulnerable groups is particularly challenging at this time considering the political and economic crisis the country is facing.
"We are not turning our backs on the most vulnerable among us, instead we are looking for solutions as individuals and unions", stated the PPSTLL President.
Pupils and their parents could also belong to risk groups, said the GEW.
On 2 April, the ZNP appealed to Poland's education minister to take a proactive approach in dealing with the crisis in education, especially concerning distance learning.
The Education International affiliate is determined to be part of the solution and has encouraged its members to actively contribute to the programmes.
The Philippines is currently under a State of National Health Emergency and a State of Calamity.
And the educational offer of the Education Ministry, prepared in cooperation with Telewizja Polska (national Polish television channel), does not meet the basic standards, nor use opportunities offered by new technologies.
The latest data from UNESCO show that a record number of students are currently unable to attend school.
As most classrooms are very narrow, 15 pupils cannot - as recommended - keep a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
According to Tepe, securing the learning and teaching environments to prevent infections should "not fail because of a lack of money".
She cautioned against measures that would ignore concerns about infection protection as well as hygiene and cleanliness.
These divides will likely worsen, as significant job losses and a recession affect the most marginalised in every society, including their families.
The government of Benin in fact rearranged the school calendar for 2019-2020, moving the Easter holidays forward, from 30 March to 13 April.
PPSTLL has emphasized the need for greater solidarity in times of crisis and has called on all its members to donate to the COVID-19 fund established by the Ministry of Health of Lebanon.
As education ministers meet today, we urge them to take into account the following points so that this major health crisis does not also become an education crisis.
Lack of decision to cancel the exams
It is also set to adopt a special economic package to compensate for salary losses caused by the temporary closure of schools, as well as by the cancellation of school events.
"Profes tiran piques" (Top Tips from Teachers): Advice on Learning from Home
The union also works to keep the public informed about the situation in education through the media.
To secure interactive communication between teachers and students, the Ministry of Education has provided free online applications.
SPASH has also asked publishers to make available school resources on diverse subjects, so that teachers can easily use them.
"Most of the education systems covered by the OECD's latest round of the Programme for International Student Assessment are not ready for the world of digital learning opportunities," concludes the report.
This would allow for a broader reach and would help to ensure that every child, no matter his/her geographical location, would be able to access educational resources.
In response to the learning crisis, the Ministry of Education has put in place distance education programmes.
SPASH urged the Education Ministry to make lessons for all classes available daily on all national TV channels.
The lack of a decision to cancel the crucial eighth-grade exam has resulted in unnecessary stress and tension among the 350,000 students and their families.
The Independent Trade Union of Education of Albania (SPASH-ITUEA) quickly established new channels of communications to liaise directly with members.
Many parents may also not be able - for a range of reasons - to facilitate their children's learning in the home environment.
In the United States of America, virtually every 15-year-old from a privileged background said they had a computer to work, but nearly one-quarter of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did not.
On 2 February, the Ministry of Education of Taiwan announced that schools were to remain closed, extending the winter holiday by two weeks in order to allow epidemic-prevention supplies to arrive in the country.
"The recommendation to wear protective masks must be implemented, i.e. masks must be made available in sufficient numbers," added the GEW head.
According to Broniarz, "this goes against the idea of equal educational opportunities for all and creates dangers for the future, for a sustainable and just society."
Meanwhile, our colleagues in higher education and research are working tirelessly to find a vaccine for COVID-19.
In addition, the union insisted that frontline personnel taking students' temperature be provided with protective masks.
In addition, the measures will negatively impact many temporary educators in terms of their employment status, possible dismissals and salary uncertainty.
Many schools also lack sufficient numbers of qualified technical assistant staff.
The union is working with the national Ministry of Education and Parliament to find solutions.
Over 363 million students at all levels of education cannot attend classes in these countries.
Respective unions in Rivera, Paysandú and Colonia Zona Este were the first to plan meal distributions for their local students.
"This donation is meant to create awareness about the virus, while urging all Liberians to take seriously the frequent washing of hands properly, that is with soap and water," stressed NTAL President Mary W.M.
At the same time, the union is working to help students with final exams.
They also warned that despite the early school holidays, markets, large gathering places, remain open and crowded, which could lead to the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
However, the Education International affiliate also recognised the precarious situation the school closures create for its members.
Although the Beninese public authorities have declared the closure of the country's schools, pupils and teachers must nevertheless resume classes on 14 April.
Receiving the items on behalf of Montserrado and Margibi counties, Samuel Bondo, CEO of Montserrado County, thanked the NTAL for the donation, welcoming it as a sign of "a great partnership in the fight against the deadly virus."
On 19 March, the Education International affiliate launched an online campaign calling for equal access to education.
"If schools and daycare centres are only opened to 'healthy and mobile' children and adolescents, additional inequalities will result," stressed Tepe.
And it has recognised the valuable contribution teachers made in the education process.
Concrete measures must be taken to ensure that the most vulnerable students are not left behind.
"The pressure on teachers and headteachers is enormous and is putting at risk their own mental and physical health and wellbeing," she went on to warn.
Besides space, a lack of teachers is another issue.
In addition, there is no access to the internet in remote areas, and, in general, broadband costs are very high, so not everyone can afford it.
The JTU is affiliated to Education International.
Educators must be remunerated as usual during closure periods.
That is according to Marlis Tepe, chairwoman of GEW and Vice-President of Education International.
A collection of international materials also helps users to understand the extent of the issue and to be responsible in their daily actions.
The donation is a reflection of the ongoing frontline presence of NTAL in the fight against COVID-19 in the country, as well as the close relationship the NTAL has maintained with public authorities during the crisis.
Before the education facilities reopen, there must be a sufficiently long lead time to allow governments to assess the situation, perform checks, and have their decisions approved by health departments.
"Teachers should be able to mark their pupils according to the exams they have already passed this year, and authorities should be willing to trust teachers in their evaluation," Tepe concluded.
We call upon governments to take concrete measures to ensure the health and safety of students and education workers.
School closures in Lebanon have affected over 1.3 million students at all levels of education.
In Denmark, Slovenia, Norway, Poland, Lithuania, Iceland, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, over 95 per cent of students reported having a computer to use for their work.
Many teachers lack the necessary training in new technologies to adapt their teaching to online methods in a few days or weeks as is required under the current circumstances.
Another issue is that adequate social distancing within schools is not possible in many facilities due to a lack of space.
On a social level, the study concludes that schools are key in the creation of effective social relationships between families, teachers and students.
Reacting to the announcement from the UK Department for Education on plans for all schools to teach children about good physical and mental health, the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers has stressed that mental health issues represent a daily fact of life for many students.
These agencies will be enlisted to recruit and pay teachers as from the resumption of classes.
"We are using social media and chat groups to continuously inform our members about the situation and their rights," said Anxhela Llalla of SPASH-ITUEA.
The union called on its members to get involved in developing content and many have volunteered to prepare and provide the televised classes.
The union reports it has been in talks with the Ministry of Education and with members of the Parliament regarding these issues, requesting support for schools and parents.
Explaining that these challenges are compounded by cuts to school staffing and to external specialist support, she reasserted that the Government must bear responsibility for the position in which schools find themselves.
The COVID-19 outbreak has led to school closures in 13 countries around the globe, disrupting the education of 290.5 million students.
Teachers and education support personnel must be remunerated during closure periods.
The National Alliance of Teachers and Office Workers (SMP-NATOW) welcomed the early suspension of classes as "the best remedy to save students and teachers from harm".

• 96% believe they encounter students who are experiencing mental health issues.
In the words of Manal Hdaife, a classroom teacher and active member of PPSTLL, "before the closures we had set up a double shift system in my school so that more children could attend.
Measures need to be put into place to minimise the impact of closures on the provision of education.
"Teaching goes beyond the confines of the classroom, which is why by educating and raising the awareness of our students we can reach every home, every workplace and every public space", reads a note signed by General Secretary Alfonso Cepeda Salas.
Education unions also play an important role in informing and supporting their membership, who should be updated regularly.
Educators are working with the government to implement the best available solutions and call for solidarity and support for the vulnerable.
Temporary educators also face serious problems as classes are suspended.
While teachers were also asked by educational authorities to post pictures and videos of them and children during the online learning sessions, SPASH immediately instructed teachers not to post anything without the written consent of the children's parents/guardians.
We've collected some of the best resources available to help guide and inspire educators.
Educators and their unions are working to provide school communities with accurate and up-to-date information from the World Health Organisation on the best preventive measures that will keep the virus from spreading.
Lack of equipment and conditions for compulsory education
"FeNaPES wants to help in any way we can so that students and their families can spend this time of health emergency in the best way possible", the organisation said on its website.
With schools closed around the country, children - especially those from poor economic backgrounds and/or with special needs - may not have access to safe and comfortable environments, cautioned the union.
Currently, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in under control in the country, stressed Li Ya-jing, Vice-President of the National Teachers' Association (NTA) and member of Education International's Regional Committee.
Reductions in staffing levels make it more difficult to support children's learning and wellbeing
Particular attention should be given to teachers in rural, remote and other marginalised areas.
While ICTs and digital technologies can provide a temporary solution to the current crisis, they are not without risks.
Online learning opportunities are on the rise globally as many teachers turn to technology to reach their pupils.
The Public Primary Schools Teachers League in Lebanon (PPSTLL) is focussing its efforts on minimising the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on disadvantaged and displaced students and communities, many of whom live in cities with little access to healthcare services.
"Announcements by successive governments about investing in education, computers and modern school equipment were just that - announcements," stated Sławomir Broniarz, ZNP President.
Make it right!
By insisting on the compulsory implementation of the core curriculum, the government shifted new responsibilities and tasks onto teachers and parents, without providing them with appropriate equipment, or access to free Internet, communication, and educational platforms.
The union is working with its members to contact students with low grades and offer remedial online sessions for those who want to improve their results.
According to the Japan Teachers' Union (JTU), students, educators, and parents are concerned about the consequences of the school closures for the provision of education, the impact on vulnerable students and the precarious situation of temporary staff.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is assessing the impact of technology on students and their learning outcomes as millions of schools close in over 140 countries to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
PPSTLL is involved in the development of the programmes, working closely with the Ministry of Education to provide advice and expertise.
Governments around the world need to develop swift, coherent and proportionate responses to the pandemic to bring it under control and minimise its impact on the health and livelihood of societies, as well as on children, young people and adults' right to quality education.
Working across ministries is essential in dealing with the wide-spread impact of the outbreak.
In addition, the issue of transporting students to school remains unresolved, with a considerable risk of contracting COVID-19 on public transport.
To the union, this situation is akin to the backdoor privatisation of the country's education system.
According to the union, the education minister does not support teachers, students, and their families.
"Teachers have never before had to deal with such a complex range of pupil welfare issues as they do today," NASUWT General Secretary Chris Keates acknowledged.
Over 1.5 billion students are affected by government closure of schools and teachers are endeavouring to use technology to maintain the teaching and learning process.
Given the inequalities in access to online learning resources, internet connection, and available study space at home for many students, the German union and its national confederation, the Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB), are calling for an exemption of final exams, including A-levels.
Teachers are being asked to deliver their lessons through online platforms.
It has also liaised with public authorities to ensure that all children have ongoing equal access to educational resources.
Nowadays, this self-evident fact is disregarded."
PPSTLL has encouraged teachers to reach out to parents over the phone and work on providing assignments, guidance and feedback to students.

With schools closed due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Albania, the Independent Trade Union of Education of Albania has moved quickly to social media and virtual group platforms to stay in touch with members.
The ZNP's position is that universal, equal, and free access to quality education should always be the norm, including during this crisis.
Other issues include infrastructure, with schools often lacking adequate bandwidth and software.
However, the union has raised concerns regarding the lack of support for teachers, the digital divide that leaves some students unable to use these tools and the learning inequalities created.
In cases where educators must stay at home and self-isolate, the union called on the government to ensure funds for substitute teachers to be brought in, so that the education process can continue.
While the school closures do not mean an automatic pass in exams, private school managers were given the authority to choose between several options, such as organising the exams online or basing the final grade on midterm results.
UNESCO has convened an emergency meeting of education ministers to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on education.
School closures put increasing pressure on already struggling families, some of whom may be facing job or income loss as a result of the pandemic and its impact on the economy.
Safeguarding the health, safety and well-being of students, teachers and education support personnel must be the number one priority.
With regard to teachers, the study is clear: "Technology can amplify the work of great teachers, but it will not replace teachers".
It has also donated items such as faucet buckets, cleaning products, sanitisers and soaps, to district education officers and institutions in the Montserrado and Margibi counties.
While school environments can be conducive to contagion and temporary shut downs of education facilities are necessary in some cases, we urge governments to take measures to minimise the impact of the outbreak on the quality of education provided to the millions of students living in affected areas.
According to UNESCO , 16 countries have implemented nationwide school and university closures to limit the spread of COVID-19.
"We want to make clear that it is impossible to replace student-teacher-classroom interaction, but with a bit of creativity and by using new technologies, we can stay active and keep our critical thinking skills sharp", says the statement, which includes teachers' suggestions for subjects such as history, music education, biology and mathematics, among others.
Governments must prepare strategies to address this possible consequence of the widespread closures.
• Over half (51%) say staff numbers at their school have decreased in the last two years, with nearly two thirds (65%) saying they are not able to give students as much individual attention in lessons due to the loss of support staff and a similar number (64%) saying students are not always taught by a teacher trained for the subject or age range due to the loss of teaching staff.
The union is concerned about a potential increase in the vulnerability of victims during these weeks of confinement, and it sets out a number of measures that should be taken, as well as relevant phone numbers for victim support services.
NASUWT: a governmental responsibility and a betrayal of teachers and students
For example, on the first day of test exams, the Central Examination Commission's servers containing the exam sheets crashed.
The trauma associated with COVID-19 can be devastating to students and educators, some of whom might have lost a loved one or colleague.
Governments should take all necessary measures to protect students and educators' personal information and data and to prevent or minimise the risks associated with technology, including cyberbullying.
The global trends towards commercialisation and competition in the higher education sector threaten to compromise quality and equity.
Given the current health emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus and the subsequent closure of educational institutions, various branches of the Federación Nacional de Profesores de Enseñanza Secundaria de Uruguay (FeNaPES) are engaged in solidarity initiatives.

They include:
In a new report, PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment)2018, the OECD analyses how well-prepared schools and students are to implement remote learning.
COVID-19: Educators call for global solidarity and a human-centred approach to the crisis
The COVID-19 crisis has had an unprecedented impact on education, with over 80% of the global student population unable to attend classes as 156 countries have implemented nation-wide school closures.
Extended school closures often lead to an increase in the drop-out rate, as some students do not return to class once schools reopen.
van Leeuwen underlined.
While in some cases negotiations have been successful and cash advances were given to educators, negotiations continue in some education institutions where the union is arguing for support to be provided in the form of grants and not loans.
It also provides resources on how to adapt to government-declared security measures that have resulted in the closure of schools.
Appropriate safeguards must be put into place to protect education systems from privatisation and commercialisation.
(iv) to proceed with the next item on the agenda.
While technology can facilitate distance learning in the short term, it is essential to understand these can only be temporary solutions that can never replace classroom teaching and learning.
It is absolutely essential to prioritise the health and safety of students, teachers and education support personnel at this time.
In Albania, schools closed on 10 March as part of the country's measures to slow the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The public authorities have also taken the decision to recruit teaching staff through interim agencies, to which education unions strongly oppose.
According to Zwiazek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego (ZNP), remote education in Poland is extremely complicated and it is only made possible because teachers have mobilised to deliver support to their students.
In Poland, despite repeated assurances, it has not been possible to create remote teaching platforms and systems that include all students.
Specific measures should be introduced to protect all educators who continue to teach and take care of the children of health and other workers in essential services.
Governments should ensure provision of professional development, learning, and support to all teachers without the skills to provide distance education and/or to use virtual, mass media and other digital tools to support their students' learning during school closures.
The National Alliance of Teachers and Office Workers is assisting its members in negotiations with employers so that educators receive financial support during school closures in the Philippines.
As a result, FeNaPES, a member organisation of Education International (EI), is undertaking solidarity actions through its own member organisations, aimed at providing support and collaboration during this difficult situation.
Teachers should also be consulted on the selection of pedagogies, digital tools and platforms used during the school closures.
Expenditure on education must be increased to fully use the potential of teachers and adequately meet the needs of students with state-of-the-art tools.
Lack of a decision to slim down the core curriculum
Education unions are also working tirelessly to ensure our members are properly informed.
Japan Teachers' Union has voiced concern over students' wellbeing during the school closures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The survey also found concerns from some teachers about the way in which student exclusions and managed moves are being conducted.
Such measures should include the provision of water and sanitation, safe and healthy teaching and learning environments and personal protective equipment such as face masks.
Following the closing of schools, FeNaPES has invited teachers from all around the country "to recommend and share materials for use while classes are not in session".
The Comité des Syndicats affiliés à l'Internationale de l'Éducation au Bénin (COSIEB) - representing all seven Education International's affiliates in the country - was moreover alarmed at the government's decision to entrust the management of some teaching staff to temporary employment agencies.
Educators are determined to keep delivering quality education to all students.
School closures also put increasing pressure on already struggling families, with working parents having to take time off to care for their children.
The country is host to large numbers of refugees who are most at risk during the crisis.
While all schools and universities have been closed since 23 March as part of the country's measures to deter the spread of COVID-19, the Papua New Guinea Teachers' Association discusses with their government ways to ensure quality education and safe return to schools for children and educators.
The majority of teachers insist that reductions in staffing levels at their school are making it more difficult to support children's learning and wellbeing.
On 10 March UNESCO announced the creation of an emergency task force and community of practice that will support national responses to the effects of the COVID-19 crisis in education.
A similar situation applies to this year's secondary school final examinations and the 250,000 students preparing to sit them.
This gesture was the union's way of reinforcing the governmental efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Education authorities should also ensure regular and timely information and updates to all employees in the sector, aiming to minimise uncertainty and related stress and anxiety.
The move to close all schools throughout the South American country poses many resultant challenges, including the need to provide assistance to students, especially in terms of food, as many schools had been providing this service.
A German education union has voiced its concern at proposals to reopen schools closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Schools are essential parts of every community and disruptions here affect the economy and can even undermine already strained health-care systems, as parents are forced to stay home with their children.
Education is a human right as expressed in international conventions and recommendations, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
In Mexico, the Education International member organisation is contributing to government efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of teachers and students and the continued provision of schooling.
If educational institutions are to reopen on a phased basis, the focus has to be on infection prevention and the health of teachers and students.
The union reiterated its appeal to the government to urgently provide free internet for students and teachers working remotely on 25 March.
The union website has a page dedicated to the pandemic with numerous resources for parents and students, from health information on how to stay safe, to recreational and cultural activities that can be done at home, as well as resources for teachers who are working remotely.
These trends must be reversed.
The Government has passed new legislation to tackle the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
She concluded highlighting that "it is a betrayal of staff and pupils to continue to expect schools alone to deal with all of these issues".
The Teachers' Union of Serbia reports educators have quickly adapted to distance teaching and learning, making the most of digital tools and using television broadcasts to ensure that all students have access to lessons while schools are closed because of the COVID-19 crisis.
Taking in to consideration the above, NTA proposes that:
The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), a member organisation of Education International, has launched a media campaign to raise awareness and educate teachers and school communities about COVID-19.
Education is a human right and a public good.
Many rely on the meals provided at school and may not have access to online tools that would allow them to access distance learning.
Delays in remote teaching platforms
The Philippines has implemented localised school closures to limit the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Quiet places to study, access to the internet - or even access to a computer - these are variables that determine the success of online learning and that show huge differences from country to country.
Therefore, the union has been focusing its efforts on negotiating with employers so that funds are provided to educators during the closures.
Governments should, therefore, ensure the provision of psycho-social support, including counselling services to all affected students, teachers and education support personnel in order to ensure their well-being, including mental health.
The most vulnerable students are disproportionally affected by school closures.
In countries where private education providers operate alongside public schools, measures must be taken so that the response is comprehensive and unified across the entire education system.
Guiding principles on the COVID-19 pandemic
Given these unprecedented developments, the COVID-19 crisis has become an education crisis.
"We, at EI, have a responsibility.
A high percentage of teachers and educators belong to risk groups, and shift operation is not possible in many schools.
Such measures can only be designed with the expertise and experiences of educators.
Issues to safeguard educator and student health include addressing how social distancing will operate in classrooms, the wearing of face masks, and infection prevention in facilities and public transport.
It shows a total contempt of the seriousness of the situation."
A whole school/education institution/community/government approach is the most effective in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping the public informed.
A whole school - whole community approach is the most effective in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping panic at bay.
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, education unionists in Poland are calling for increased funding for education and broad access to remote teaching and learning so that education can continue, and the health of educators and their students can be safeguarded.
Governments must ensure that concrete response and recovery measures are implemented in a rapid manner to ensure that the most vulnerable students are not left behind.
The Education Ministry has responded positively to some of the union's recommendations: lessons are being recorded and broadcast on national TV and some Internet
The school community must be provided with accurate education, information and guidance on preventive measures.
Lengthy school closures cause major disruptions to the education of millions of students.
The ZNP has been communicating with members daily via its free mobile application, and publishes the weekly magazine, Głos Nauczycielski (Teacher's Voice), with analyses and legal advice.
In line with EI's Protocol on ICTs , the professional views of teachers on the use of digital platforms and programmes must be at the forefront of approaches to distance learning.
This conference will then provide guidance to WIPO's Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights on what actions will need to be taken at WIPO in the context of education, research, libraries, archives and museums.
In recent years the higher education and research sector has witnessed a series of attacks which have undermined the principles of academic freedom and collegiality, and the intrinsic value of knowledge acquisition, transmission and analysis.
The school/education community must be provided with accurate education, information and guidance on preventive measures.
Over 63 million teachers and large numbers of education support personnel have also been affected by the pandemic.
AMENDMENTS TO THE BY-LAWS
In Liceo de Playa Pascual, on Wednesday the 25th, with the presence of José Olivera and Marcel Slamovitz (union President and Vice President of FeNaPES), teachers launched a community potluck that is set to run three times a week.
Such measures may include distance education programmes, virtual/online learning, TV, radio and other similar initiatives.

education funding
Considering the COVID19 outbreak and for public health concerns, public events scheduled for the 18 March have been suspended.
Education has been one of the sectors most affected by the neoliberal policies of the Jair Bolsonaro government.
The CNTE Executive Board stated that "successive cuts in the budgets of federal universities and institutes, academic research, health and social assistance compromise the quality of life of the population, deny a promising future to new generations and place the country in a situation of generalised insecurity in several areas, including combatting epidemics and pandemics like the one we are witnessing at the moment".
During the Council of Global Unions meeting held in London last week, global union leaders representing over 200 million workers, including Education International's General Secretary David Edwards, sent a message of solidarity and support to colleagues in Brazil.
In addition, the government's plans to reform the public sector will brutally undo many of the victories and rights of public sector workers.
The proposed restructuring of the Basic Education Fund (FUNDEB) will undermine the financing of transport and school meals, textbooks, training for education professionals, construction and renovation of schools, among other programmes.
The trade union centre in Brazil - Central Única de los trabajadores de Brasil (CUT) - and other organisations have announced they are joining the action and will mark 18 March as a day of General Strike for Education and in Defence of Public Services.
The strike will go ahead in schools and other workplaces and protesters have been encouraged to voice their concerns online.
The nationwide strike in education was called after the Bolsonaro administration announced further measures that would decrease public investment in education, despite already insufficient levels.
The Confederación Nacional de Trabajadores de Educación (CNTE), Education International affiliate in Brazil, has called a major nationwide strike in education, protesting the policies of the Bolsonaro administration.
Education unionists were soon joined by workers in other sectors, after Bolsonaro made a series of statements against democracy and announced new legislation that would undermine the rights of workers, such as legalising precarious work or taxing unemployed people.
As a growing number of countries are considering easing restrictions and gradually resuming onsite education, Education International stresses a set of five dimensions that should be considered by governments, in dialogue with educators and their unions, when planning this next phase of responding to the COVID-19 crisis in education.
Education International Guidance to Reopening Schools and Education Institutions
Here are 5 big issues and opportunities", by Andy Hargreaves.
Recalling that:
Noting that:
"What's next for schools after coronavirus?
In 1996, the Republic of Korea joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The legalization of the KTU in 1999 was in line with this international commitment.
The 7th Education International (EI) World Congress meeting in Ottawa, Canada, from 21nd to 26th July 2015:
This is a major attack on the education trade union movement in Korea.
Resolution on delegalization of the Korean Teachers and education workers Union (KTU)
The Education International 7th World Congress therefore mandates the Executive Board, in cooperation with member organizations, to request that the South Korean government:
ii) Amend the Trade Union and Labour Relations Adjustment Act and Teachers Union Act, as has been repeatedly requested by the ILO Committee of Freedom of Association; and
On 28th May, 2015, the Constitutional Court decided that the article is constitutional.
On October 24th, 2013, the Government cancelled KTU's registration as a trade union.
EI immediately issued an Urgent Action Appeal regarding this case and teacher unions over the world sent protest letters to President Park Guen-hye.
The aforementioned members of the KTU were dismissed during the previous administration for activities which included expression of their opinion on the governments' education policy or for making donations to progressive political parties.
Through its various committees, the International Labour Organisation has repeatedly urged the government to repeal this provision from its legislation.
The Global Campaign for Education (GCE) called on the South Korean authorities to respect the basic union rights of teachers by passing a motion unanimously at its World Assembly in Johannesburg, South Africa, in February, 2015.
The right to decide whether or not a trade union should represent retired or dismissed workers for the defence of their specific interests is a question pertaining only to the internal autonomy of all trade unions.
However, Article 2 of the current Teacher Union Act states that only practicing teachers may be members of the union.
With this ruling, the Seoul High Court's process resumed and on 2nd June, the Supreme Court decided that the union would lose its legal status.
However, on 19th September, the Appeal Court accepted an injunction from the KTU and asked the Constitutional Court to decide whether Article 2 of the Teacher Union Act is in line with the Korean Constitution.
These workers, whose dismissals are also suspect under international law, are considered members of KTU under its constitution.
iii) Comply fully with international labour standards by respecting and promoting freedom of association for Korean educators.
The office of Park Geun-hye focused its attention on nine dismissed teachers who worked at the KTU head office, and in 2013 threatened KTU with deregistration.
The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) has repeatedly criticized these exclusions, reiterating that, "It urged the government to repeal the provisions prohibiting dismissed and unemployed workers from keeping their union membership and making non-union members ineligible to stand for trade union office.
i) Immediately withdraw its measure to delegalize the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union, as this measure itself represents a serious regression of worker rights to the past; and
In doing so the Republic pledged that it would guarantee the freedom of association and union activities of teachers.
Education International (EI) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) requested the International Labour Organization (ILO) to urgently intervene with the government of the Republic of Korea on the threat to cancel the registration of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU) if it did not amend its constitution.
In March and again in October 2013, the ILO urgently intervened with the Korean government concerning allegations of serious infringement of trade union rights in the Republic of Korea, in particular the threat of cancellation of the registration of the KTU and the need to amend the Trade Union and Labour Relations Adjustment Act with regard to the provisions prohibiting dismissed and unemployed workers from keeping their membership and making non-union members ineligible to stand for trade union office.
The KTU has been deprived of legal recognition simply because its constitution allows dismissed teachers to stay in the union or stand for union office.
Allowing retired and dismissed workers to be union members and leaders is internationally accepted, but Korean labour law does not reflect this reality.
On 19th June, 2014, a court upheld the government's action.
Noting with regret that the government has not repealed these provisions, the Committee once again urges the government to do so." In March, 2014, the CFA stated that "The Committee takes note with deep concern of the decertification of the KTU … ensure the re-certification of the KTU without delay."
The Conclusions of the conference are available here .
Conference participants were welcomed by the dean Ho-Chiao Chuang, who gave an introduction to the university.
Participants agreed that such examples should be used in EI advocacy work.
Study visit to Taipei Tech - the National Taipei University of Technology
They identified the following worrying political developments: the emergence of authoritarian governments, the weakening and assault on democratic institutions and rights, and the fuelling by many political leaders of xenophobia and racism.
Across the groups, the main area of agreement was that performance metrics are inadequate as the focus is upon quantity rather than quality.
There was a proposal to gather examples of misuse or distortion of such systems, including student evaluation surveys, institutional rankings, fake articles or unreliable results published in high-ranked journals, and the "recycling" of research to present longer lists of publications.
These developments have led to increased pressures on academic freedom, which is essential for the aims and mission of tertiary education institutions to serve democracy and the common good of society through the preservation, advance and dissemination of knowledge.
After the conference, a study visit to Taipei Tech - the National Taipei University of Technology was organised.
Seventy union leaders and activists representing teachers, academics and researchers in institutes, colleges and universities from 26 countries and territories across the globe gathered for the Education International (EI) 11th International Further and Higher Education and Research Conference (IFHERC) in Taipei, Taiwan, from 12-14 November.
During discussions at Education International's 11th International Further and Higher Education and Research Conference, participants from all corners of the world voiced great concern about political developments across the different regions that undermine academic freedom.
EI's 11th IFHERC highlights the importance of promoting and protecting academic freedom in an increasingly hostile environment
On the second day of IFHERC, participants divided into group sessions discussing how various forms of performance metrics, from student evaluation surveys and citation indexes to university rankings, are used, and misused, to assess teaching, research, and institutional performance.
Afterwards, they were divided into two group and took turns visiting the Control and System integration laboratory, which includes a robotics manufacturing zone and an automated visual inspection and assembly line, as well as the Taiwan Start-up Institute, featuring a 3D printer.
Key takeaways from the conference discussions
"How the COVID-19 crisis may impact higher education unions' work and strategy on casualisation", by Rob Copeland.
"Transforming economies and the financing of public education post-COVID", by David Archer.
We must address them directly."
Teachers and their unions must be consulted
The SNAES has created, with the support of three inspectorates, a document which provides teachers with twenty or so model lesson plans.
Kaffo also highlights the fact that during this COVID-19 crisis, Internet access remains very unequal in Cameroon for multiple reasons, in particular: a lack of computers and other electronic tablets, poor coverage in rural areas, low connection speeds, the high cost of connecting, the weakness of the electricity network, and frequent power cuts.
It also maintains that distance learning should take place in better conditions and that access to it should be available throughout the country.
He asserts: "I don't believe that implicitly addressing the main actors in a strategy is effective.
He continues: "As regards the implementation of measures thus taken for the continuity of schooling during the COVID-19 crisis, we note indisputable efforts concerning classes for pupils in examination years, but these are very unequally distributed based on the issues previously set out.
This is only a start and this concern must be more thoroughly addressed if we want to successfully encourage teachers to create lessons and put them online."
Ensuring equal access to quality education for all
Improving professional development for teachers in connection with online classes
Concerning the use of information and communication technologies in Cameroon to prepare teachers to give online classes, it is "marginal" according to Roger Kaffo, General Secretary of the Syndicat National Autonome de l'Enseignement Secondaire (SNAES) and Deputy General Secretary of the Fédération des Syndicats de l'Enseignement et de la Recherche - one of Education International's member organisations with which SNAES is affiliated.
Kaffo believes that these issues must be urgently addressed if we are to avoid increasing the inequalities in access to education between young people.
He goes on to add that "with online classes specifically, there is a huge amount of work to be done to improve the confidence that teachers have in themselves to create classes at the right level that can be put online."
While acknowledging that the government seems to have taken these limitations into account in the implementation of broadcast and video-based classes, about which teachers were informed by letter on 31 March, Kaffo deeply regrets that the Ministry of Basic Education did not consult teacher unions, nor teachers when designing these classes.
Teachers are increasingly using Information Technology, however, within the context of independent education because of computer labs that are being progressively introduced in secondary but not primary schools.
has to be said that the situation is not good."
Kaffo notes that, with some support from external partners, it has been possible to organise training for a limited number of teachers.
Kaffo states that "Unfortunately, teachers who are, first and foremost, focused on their own individual survival do not really consider the use of new technologies to
While acknowledging that teachers had already been offered training to help them develop the skills needed to deliver online classes before the COVID-19 crisis had begun, educators should be better trained in the area according to an education trade union in Cameroon.
Similarly, he explains that teachers are given few examples of online classes that they would be able to prepare during inspections, and many, therefore, feel lost:
The SNAES has chosen to remedy this deficiency by directly approaching teachers and raising awareness among them.
trade union rights
These policies affect most of the Argentinian people and the entire working class.
"What the Covid-19 Pandemic will change in education depends on the thoughtfulness of education responses today", by Fernando M. Reimers.
Education International extends its support and solidarity to Argentinian workers in their call for a National Strike on Tuesday, 30th April.
The workers are organising together to mobilise against economic reforms, indebtedness and policies implemented by the government of Mauricio Macri.
The union action is organised by the CTA-T, the CTA-A and hundreds of unions belonging to the Trade Union Front for the National Model, the Federal Current and the "21F" Movement, all grouped under the CGT (General Confederation of Labour).
It is for this reason that workers demand that the misguided pension reforms be repealed, reject the labour reforms, and march united against the persecution of trade union, social and political leaders who speak out against this model of dismissals, poverty and exclusion.
Joining in the strike are CTERA and CONADU, member organisations of Education International.
Instead, the trade unions call for decent wages and free collective bargaining and support a model based on work, productivity and social inclusion.
Positive feedback
"This will create a realistic basis for adequate evaluation of their work at the end of crisis," she said.
TV screening
Overall, though, teachers are satisfied with how this method of education is functioning in practice.
That's according to Borka Visnic, International Cooperation Officer of the Teachers' Union of Serbia.
For her, an important issue for teachers is their remuneration during this state-of-emergency period, and they have been reassured that they will receive the same salary as before.
The higher education sector had already been organising online classes for students.
"Students consider this way of learning interesting and many parents become more engaged and aware of the importance of teaching and the teaching profession."
Teachers are obliged to report daily on progress made and results obtained, following the outcomes of each student.
Since 17 March, the day after the state of emergency was declared in their country, teachers in Serbia have moved their work online.
Classes were screened on two Serbian Broadcast Company TV channels, making them available for all children across the country.
As the safety of students and teachers is its most important concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Teachers' Union of Serbia is in contact daily with members to provide them with support to overcome all issues arising from this difficult time, Visnic said.
To prepare and deliver the lessons, teachers have been using all the knowledge and skills they received over the last few years in preparation for the digitalisation of education.
Efforts to continue education despite the crisis have received positive feedback from students and parents.
"The first feedback has been very positive from students and their parents," Visnic highlighted.
However, teachers are under pressure to be available for all students and communicate not only after the classes but also using different learning platforms and social tools, she stressed.
"It is of utmost importance to deliver lessons using TV channels for all people in all corners of the country, so that all students are put in an equal position and get the same quality of education," Visnic underlined.
However, online classes were prepared in a very short time, firstly for elementary schools, then for secondary, and vocational education and training schools.
To improve communication by using new technologies, it is necessary to supply all students with more new devices to avoid discrimination among students on the basis of different social background, she said.
On 23 March, education delivered in minority languages and education for migrant children commenced.
The Teachers' Union of Serbia reports educators have quickly adapted to distance teaching and learning, making the most of digital tools and using television broadcasts to ensure that all students have access to lessons while schools are closed because of the COVID-19 crisis.
All education institutions have closed - from preschool education, elementary and secondary schools, to vocational education and training and higher education institutions.
Every situation is different.
It has spread to all continents of the world.
Already, opening dates have been announced in several countries.
They are planned.
That means that teachers may be especially vulnerable to infection.
That means that social distancing will require considerable logistical and cultural changes.
They should be permitted to continue to work from home or make other arrangements.
To make school reopening as safe as possible, a number of factors need to be taken into consideration.
For small children, social distancing is bizarre behaviour and hard to understand.
Every effort should be made to ensure that risks are reduced to the minimum through best practices based on science, not politics, and anchored in cooperation and social dialogue."
"The reopening of schools can be a massive risk for teachers and other education workers.
Regardless of circumstances, even though more information is becoming available, what is not known about this virus remains more important than what we know.
However, even in those situations, there may be a risk of unleashing a second wave.
It is another reason that re-opening must be careful and methodical.
In countries where great progress has been made and where tests and protective devices are widely available, reopening may be relatively safe.
Workers in education, particularly teachers, are often older than the larger population because it has been hard, in recent years, to recruit new talent.
Even for older students, it may be difficult to respect due to limits of space, but also because of the normal rush of school life; getting from one class to another, to lunch and leaving at the end of the day.
Work-related stress has become a major issue for teachers in many countries as has been documented by the recent OECD TALIS report .
Such protections will be especially challenging in countries with limited possibilities to provide those protections and weak public health systems.
Social distancing, a crucial element of the combat against COVID-19, under the best of circumstances, will be difficult in schools and, in some cases, may be impossible.
Education personnel, particularly from high-risk groups, should not be required to go back to school.
It is the health and lives of those workers that are most at stake."
International Workers' Memorial Day is, in this dark year, not only a way to recognise those who have already sacrificed, but to chart a path that restores trust and hope and gives us a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel."
Often, they are the same countries, with strong social dialogue traditions, where there were already discussions of closures.
Although in our sectors, many are tele-working or on leave, this will change with the opening of schools.
In some countries where school re-opening has been scheduled, there have been consultations and/or negotiations with education trade unions on the details of occupational health and safety protections.
Reopening decisions are neither urgent nor abrupt.
For those in direct contact with others, including many working in education, it is an occupational health and safety challenge.
However, the EI survey of member organisations on COVID-19 showed that the governments that acted correctly at that time were exceptional.
We also will fight for their health and lives in the present and for the future.
They include whether there has been a significant decline in the general risk, the existence of widespread testing and monitoring, the availability of protective devices, regular disinfection, and modifications of physical arrangements and measures such as staggered classes and reduced class sizes.
Trade unions should be fully involved in reopening planning and decisions.
David Edwards, Education International General Secretary stated: "For growing numbers of workers in education and other sectors, the worksite will become the greatest source of risk for COVID-19.
Existing stress factors in education will be aggravated by fear of contamination during re-opening and, perhaps, for months to come.
There is no excuse for not involving the representatives of workers, their trade unions, in reopening decisions and ongoing occupational health and safety vigilance.
Some deaths, with proper precautions and protections, could have been avoided.
"COVID-19 may be a natural disaster, but avoidable illness and death is human failure.
Hallways and staircases in many schools before the pandemic were already too narrow to easily accommodate normal traffic.
COVID-19 and other infectious diseases contracted at work, should be recognised.
With re-opening, in addition to the ongoing public health danger to all, exposure at the workplace will become a major, perhaps the major risk.
The international day was born in 1996 to mourn those who had died on the job and to fight for the living.
They should be given the same treatment, including compensation, as other occupational diseases.
The Statement of the Council of Global Unions on the recognition of COVID-19 as an occupational disease, released on the occasion of International Workers Memorial Day 2020, is also available here
COVID-19 is a pandemic that is lethal on a large scale.
On this day, EI mourns all workers, but especially education workers, who have died at work and in the line of duty.
International Workers' Memorial Day on occupational health and safety, observed the 28th of April every year.
While all schools and universities have been closed since 23 March as part of the country's measures to deter the spread of COVID-19, the Papua New Guinea Teachers' Association discusses with their government ways to ensure quality education and safe return to schools for children and educators.
COVID-19
A new draft law in response to the COVID 19 pandemic in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) will have an impact on schools and teacher training - the German education union VBE says teachers need to be included in the decision-making.
However, these decisions should be made with the involvement of practical experience as far as possible", says Stefan Behlau, state chairman of VBE NRW.
As a growing number of countries are considering easing restrictions and gradually resuming onsite education, Education International stresses a set of five dimensions that should be considered by governments, in dialogue with educators and their unions, when planning this next phase of responding to the COVID-19 crisis in education.
The regional government implemented the school closures on 25 February.
While public health is the clear priority, quarantine measures have resulted in financial difficulties for many families, including those of teachers.
Educators are also encouraged to get in touch with their students in whatever ways are available to provide guidance and support.
On social media, the union launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the basic steps every person can take to stem the spread of the virus.
In terms of the provision of education during the closures, the Ministry of Education is exploring distance learning solutions to limit the disruptions.
Instead, the union has proposed extending the academic year and providing televised lessons in order to reach the largest possible number of students.
The Kurdistan Teachers' Union continues to work with the government to develop solutions for continued education during the crisis.
However, the Kurdistan Teachers' Union has expressed concerns about the effectiveness and equity of distance learning, considering that many families and students do not have the devices and internet connection needed to access online education.
Early on, the Education International member organisation advocated for schools and universities in the Kurdistan region to close in order to protect the health and safety of students, staff and entire communities.
The union's efforts to convince the government to expedite the salaries of education workers have been successful, providing much-needed relief to many.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Kurdistan Teachers' Union has been working tirelessly to ensure the safety of school communities, secure financial support for educators and continued education for students.
The risk of contagion is not limited to students.
This is intended to minimise the spread of COVID-19.
Risk to teachers and support staff
Exposed to unnecessary risk
They are to observe social distancing protocols as they prepare for their examinations, which begin in May and June 2020, respectively.
Change exam timetables
Musah commended President Akufo-Addo for the measures taken so far to curb the spread of the virus in the country, citing the $100-million financial commitment by the government as a laudable initiative.
"Roughly, more than 1,000,000 students, teachers and non-teaching staff will be meeting on a daily basis during the examinations, and that is the basis for our suggestion to the President to consider including the candidates in the shutdown."
The unions have asked the government to suggest a possible change in the examinations timetable for the West African Education Council member states (Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gambia).
In addition, some teachers had created platforms with parents to give assignments to students to prepare them adequately for the examinations.
All universities, secondary and primary schools, both private and public, were closed until further notice.
Speaking on behalf of the four concerned unions, Musah said that schools should not be "turned into incubation centres for the COVID-19".
There are currently 397,500 students in the last year of primary school due to undertake the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) in June 2020.
An additional 490,882 students are set to complete the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).
"Teachers and other supporting staff who are preparing pupils for the examinations" are also at risk, according to Thomas T. Musah, General Secretary of the GNAT.
However, final-year students of primary and upper secondary levels have been excluded from the ban and must attend school.
Otherwise, the students could be exposed to the unnecessary risk of contracting the COVID-19 disease, according to the unions.
With seven declared cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Ghana, the government declared, on 21 March, a ban on all public gatherings for the next four weeks.
Assignments to students
The unions lobbying the Government include three affiliates of Education International (EI): the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), the National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT), and the Teachers and Educational Workers Union (TEWU).
He said that teachers had made homework, exercises, textbooks, and project work available to students.
Now, education unions in Ghana are calling for these two groups of final-year students to be included in the lockdown measures for schools.
The Coalition of Concerned Teachers, Ghana (CCT-GH) is also amongst those warning of the danger that school attendance implies for the final-year students.
Teachers and educators in Ghana are urging President Akufo-Addo to extend the four-week shutdown of basic and second-cycle schools to final-year students.
The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación (SNTE), a member organisation of Education International, has launched a media campaign to raise awareness and educate teachers and school communities about COVID-19.
In Mexico, the Education International member organisation is contributing to government efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of teachers and students and the continued provision of schooling.
Disease transmission is under control.
Make Equity a Top Priority
The risk of importing new cases "can be managed".
Engage in Social and Policy Dialogue
Ensure the Health and Safety of Education Communities
Support Physical and Emotional Wellbeing and Recovery
Health systems are able to "detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact".
A strategy is developed for addressing possible increases in drop-out rates, paying particular attention to girls and women, and those at risk of child labour.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted six conditions that should be met before governments start to lift current restrictions on social and physical movement related to the spread of COVID-19:
Consideration is given to the additional workload arising from the parallel requirement of face-to-face and online teaching during the gradual re-opening of schools.
The labour rights of teachers and education support personnel are respected and decent working conditions are maintained.
Communities are fully educated, engaged, and empowered to live under a new normal.
Education International Guidance to Reopening Schools and Education Institutions
With schools and education institutions closed in a majority of countries, there are critical issues for governments to take into consideration, as countries gradually begin to re-open early childhood institutions, schools and higher education institutions.
Hot spot risks are minimized in vulnerable places, such as nursing homes.
It is imperative that governments communicate transparently and continuously about the plans for reopening onsite education and the extent to which they are informed by the advice of health experts.
In addition to the pandemic causing ongoing stress and anxiety, many children, students and education staff will also find it difficult to return to school and adapt to new routines as well as restrictions to social interaction.
Education workers have guaranteed access to Personal Protective Equipment where necessary, and additional funds and staffing are ensured by public authorities to ensure health and safety requirements.
Continuous social and policy dialogue with educators and their unions is the cornerstone of any successful education strategy.
Trust the professionalism of educators
A support structure is put in place for all vulnerable students and staff, for those who are enduring increased hardship and for students who have not been able to participate in online or home-based learning.
Dedicated support is available to those who may have suffered bereavement, abuse, violence, or other emotional trauma.
In addition, the situation of at-risk and vulnerable students, staff and their families is taken into consideration.
All schools and education institutions are equipped to ensure and sustain enhanced hygiene and cleaning practices and all staff is informed and trained to follow new guidelines.
Any framework for transitioning back to onsite education is built on trust in the professionalism and pedagogical practice of the education workforce.
As a growing number of countries are considering easing restrictions and gradually resuming onsite education, Education International stresses a set of five dimensions that should be considered by governments, in dialogue with educators and their unions, when planning this next phase of responding to the COVID-19 crisis in education.
Schools, workplaces and other essential places have established preventive measures.
Equity is front and centre of all transition plans, recognising that the impact of the pandemic is not equal and that already vulnerable students and education workers have been and may continue to be the most affected.
Systems are in place to support the wellbeing and mental health of children, students and education staff, including through dedicated psychosocial support and counselling.
There is agreement and clarity on the hygiene measures necessary for keeping children, students and staff safe and healthy as well as preventative measures for containing the spread of the virus.
Education authorities engage with educators and their unions to determine and assess the impact of the school closures on teaching, learning and student wellbeing.
Public authorities engage in continuous social and policy dialogue with educators and their representative unions and organisationsto assess needs and agree on health and safety measures for students and staff as well as the framework and resources for transitioning back to onsite teaching and learning.
Clarity on any assessment requirements is reached in dialogue with educators and their unions to ensure fair and equal treatment of all students and the continued professional autonomy of educators.
Resolution on austerity policies in Greece
These policies cannot lead to growth and have already created a humanitarian crisis in the country.
The 7th Education International (EI) World Congress meeting in Ottawa, Canada, from 21nd to 26th July 2015:
Declares that austerity policies and cuts in the public budget, allocated for social services (education, health, welfare) affect all the people, particularly the poorest and the most vulnerable and have to be stopped.
Supports the rights of workers to protest and demonstrate against austerity.
Expresses its full support to teachers and workers in Greece in their struggle against the continuation of austerity policies imposed in Greece by the EU, the ECB and the IMF in an antidemocratic way with a new memorandum-agreement July 2015.
Demands that governments stop austerity policies, address the burden of public debt and increase the public budget for education.
Role of schools
Not a level playing field
"Online learning has changed from a nice-to-have extracurricular facility to becoming the lifeline for education," according to Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's head of the Directorate of Education and Skills.
What comes after the crisis?
"Human rights are indivisible."
The government alone has the authority to put these measures in place.
We must also stand firm for democracy and our values.
For the past 130 years, the 1st of May has been a day of mobilisation and hope.
This is understandable and pragmatic in the current situation.
This May Day we must imagine the future we want and work together to achieve it.
We cannot and must not go back to a world of individualism where capital rules supreme.
Solidarity must not end at national borders
Statement | May Day 2020 - Creating the future we want
As the world slowly emerges from this catastrophe, a global economic crisis looms on the horizon.
Nsengiyumva emphasises, however, that his union believes these measures to be insufficient.
It will take mobilisation, organisation and education.
Today, 1 May 2020 is truly unprecedented.
She said the conditions in so-called "hotspots" were catastrophic even before the coronavirus pandemic.
For example, schools have not yet been closed and public gatherings are still not banned.
"We are currently advocating for trade union involvement and collaboration with the government on certain propositions.
Tepe called on the German Federal Government to act on its promise and implement its 9 March decision to admit up to 1,500 particularly vulnerable children.
Many authoritarians have and will continue to use this crisis to strengthen their grip on power.
To honour their memory and for our own sake, we have a duty to make sure that the world that emerges after this crisis is better than the one before.
While this pandemic poses a great threat to the health of millions, its consequences run much deeper.
Tepe also criticised the suspension of the right to asylum and the hesitant attitude of EU governments to accept those in need of protection.
The first lesson we have learned from this crisis is that we can only overcome it by working together, making sacrifices to protect complete strangers who in turn protect us.
This is not a choice anyone should be forced to make.
"The aim must be to achieve a broad consensus both on decisions concerning transfers and on the paths taken to award official degrees.
The bill, which is to be passed in the state parliament this week, "enables the Ministry of Education to react to various scenarios that may arise from the dynamics of the situation.

Covid-19 has highlighted some of the fundamental inequalities that dominate our daily lives.
The PNGTA will send a letter to the government proposing ways to allow for some level of teaching and learning in schools.
He believes that if the government and public do not take this pandemic seriously, it will be up to the unions to take the lead on raising awareness.
While millions work from home, hundreds of millions have seen their livelihoods threatened.
Now more than ever, it is imperative to remember that healthcare, education and all public services have been crippled by years of underfunding in the name of austerity and economic recovery.
The "Can't Wash My Hands" initiative (in German) has also provided interested people with a platform for action and networking to support the demands and activities in camps.
"We are in favour of schools reopening to some extent and, given that all necessary precautions are taken, to allow for some degree of teaching and learning to take place for the benefit of students," he explained.
Their mobilisation has been truly outstanding.
On this day we celebrate workers, the trade union movement and the colossal difference it has made for billions around the world.
Half of the world has no access to the internet and hundreds of millions do not have access to electricity.
GEW is endorsing the demands of civil society that the refugee camps be evacuated immediately, and that humanitarian aid be provided.
Around 42,000 refugees are living in camps on the Greek islands where any attempt to contain or even slow a possible COVID-19 outbreak would fail, said GEW President Marlis Tepe.
Behlau added that proposed changes to procedures should be made in close coordination with teachers.
For the most unfortunate, the choice is truly tragic: stay at home and prioritise health or provide for the family.
For those lucky enough to have kept a job, a healthy work-life balance has become a luxury.
It is also a time to look ahead and find optimism and motivation in our shared vision of a better, fairer world with social justice, equity, freedom, prosperity and peace.
Many have donated wages to solidarity funds to help their students and communities.
"My union highlights that teachers should be used more to raise awareness within their communities."

The GEW leader also highlighted the willingness of 141 German municipalities and cities that formed an alliance to become "safe harbours" , declaring #WeHaveSpace.
Education unions have organised to come up with solutions, providing learning materials, food and even mobile internet capacity to the most vulnerable.
We must remain vigilant and make sure human and labour rights, an independent press and the very notion of truth do not fall prey to fear and manipulation.
However, because there has been only one case of infection, there could be some easing of restrictions, suggested the General Secretary of the Papua New Guinea Teachers' Association (PNGTA), Ugwalubu Mowana.
Mowana stressed.
Even so, public health specialists and development workers warn that the country's high rates of poverty, poor nutrition, poor health services, and pre-existing health problems such as tuberculosis make the population highly vulnerable to the disease.
This means supporting teachers and all education workers, respecting their professional autonomy, working with them and their unions, and investing in public education in all countries.
The refugee camps in Greece are threatening to become "death traps", according to Pro Asyl , a German non-governmental organisation that advocates for the rights of refugees and migrants in Germany and Europe.
It must be clear that, in addition to the important issues concerning final examinations and the Abitur (German A-levels), the school education of all pupils is also at stake."
Even in developed countries, millions of children and students cannot count on a personal computer or even a quiet place to study.
Beyond the immediate crisis response, this experience has also fully confirmed that distance education cannot replace school communities; that tablets, videos and online platforms cannot replace trained, qualified and supported educators.
Representatives have taken the following measures in their schools and communities:
We will not stand by and allow this to continue.
We most notably want to recommend closing schools before the worst happens," he highlighted.
The government's measures, declared as a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, included a curfew imposed on the country's approximately eight million residents, a restriction of travel within the country, and the closure of all schools and universities.
As situations stabilise and schools begin to re-open, the priority must become strengthening free quality public education for all - the only way to overcome the deep-seated inequalities of the world.
A German education union has joined the "Leave No One Behind" campaign which seeks the immediate evacuation of overcrowded refugee camps at the EU's external borders.
On 2 April, the government of Papua New Guinea extended the shutdown and closure of educational settings for another two months, extending its original 14-day state of emergency declared on 23 March.
The campaign argues that the situation of refugees has been made worse by the COVID-19 crisis.
To prepare for the event, EI published an infographic that portrays how copyright laws affect 10 educational activities in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

It has already urged public authorities to allocate an adequate amount of financial means to the Department of Education to ensure that teaching and learning, resource and curriculum development are sustained.
Many have died making sure others survived.
But we can count on enormous support from across the world because the essential role of public services has been recognised and the importance of all workers is painfully apparent to everyone.
